<a name="sec21"></a>21. I have already noted that sense-datum theorists are impressed
by the question &quot;How can a physical object look red to S, unless
something in that situation <i>is</i> red and S is taking account of it?
If S isn't experiencing something red, how does it happen that
the physical object looks <i>red</i>, rather than green or streaky?&quot;
There is, I propose to show, <i>something</i> to this line of
thought, though the story turns out to be a complicated one. And
if, in the course of telling the story, I shall be led to make
statements which resemble <i>some</i> of the things sense-datum
theorists have said, this story will amount to a sense-datum 
theory only in a sense which robs this phrase of an entire
dimension of its traditional epistemological force, a dimension
which is characteristic of even such heterodox forms of
sense-datum theory as the &quot;another language&quot; approach.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let me begin by formulating the question: &quot;Is the fact that an
object looks to S to be red and triangular, or that there looks
to S to be a red and triangular object over there, to be
explained in terms of the idea that Jones has a sensation -- or
impression, or immediate experience -- of a red triangle? One point
can be made right away, namely that if these expressions are so
understood that, say, the immediate experience of a red triangle
implies the existence of something -- not a physical object -- which
<i>is</i> red and triangular, and if the redness which this item has is
the same as the redness which the physical object <i>looks</i> to
have, then the suggestion runs up against the objection that the
redness physical objects <i>look</i> to have is the same as the redness
physical objects actually <i>do</i> have, so that items which <i>ex
hypothesi</i> are not physical objects, and which radically, even
categorially, differ from physical objects, would have the same
redness as physical object. And while this is, perhaps, not
entirely out of the question, it certainly provides food for
thought. Yet when it is claimed that &quot;obviously&quot; physical objects
can't <i>look</i> red to one unless one is experiencing something
that <i>is</i> red, is it not presumed that the redness which the
<i>something</i> has is the redness which the physical object
<i>looks to have</i>?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now there are those who would say that the question &quot;Is the fact
that an object looks red and triangular to S to be explained -- as
opposed to notationally reformulated -- in terms of the idea that S
has an impression of a red triangle?&quot; simply doesn't arise, on
the ground that there are perfectly sound explanations of
qualitative and existential lookings which make no reference to
'immediate experiences' or other dubious entities. Thus, it is
pointed out, it is perfectly proper to answer the question &quot;Why
does this object look red?&quot; by saying &quot;Because it is an orange
object looked at in such and such circumstances.&quot; The explanation
is, in principle, a good one, and is typical of the answers we
make to such questions in everyday life. But because these
explanations are good, it by no means follows that explanations
of other kinds might not be equally good, and, perhaps, more
searching.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec22"></a>22. On the face of it there are at least two ways in which
additional, but equally legitimate explanations <i>might</i> be
forthcoming for such a fact as that <i>x looks red</i>. The first
of these is suggested by a simple analogy. Might it not be the
case that just as there are two kinds of good explanation of the
fact that this balloon has expanded, (a) in terms of the
Boyle-Charles
laws which relate the empirical concepts of volume, pressure, and
temperature pertaining to gases, and (b) in terms of the kinetic
theory of gases; so there are two ways of explaining the fact
that this object looks red to S: (a) in terms of empirical
generalizations relating the colors of objects, the circumstances
in which they are seen, and the colors they look to have, and (b)
in terms of a theory of perception in which 'immediate
experiences' play a role analogous to that of the molecules of
the kinetic theory.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now there is such an air of paradox to the idea that 'immediate
experiences' are <i>mere</i> theoretical entities -- entities, that
is, which are postulated, along with certain fundamental
principles concerning them, to explain uniformities pertaining to
sense perception, as molecules, along with the principles of
molecular motion, are postulated to explain the experimentally
determined regularities pertaining to gases -- that I am going to
lay it aside until a more propitious context of thought may make
it seem relevant. Certainly, those who have thought that
qualitative and existential lookings are to be explained in terms
of 'immediate experiences' thought of the latter as the most
untheoretical of entities, indeed, as <i>the</i> observables
<i>par excellence</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let us therefore turn to a second way in which, at least prima
facie, there might be an additional, but equally legitimate
explanation of existential and qualitative lookings. According to
this second account, when we consider items of this kind, we
<i>find</i> that they contain as components items which are
properly referred to as, for example, 'the immediate experience
of a red triangle.' Let us begin our exploration of this
suggestion by taking another look at our account of existential
and qualitative lookings. It will be remembered that our account
of qualitative looking ran, in rough and ready terms, as
follows:
<p>
<blockquote>
'x looks red to S' has the sense of 'S has an experience which
involves in a unique way the idea <i>that x is red</i> and
involves it in such a way that if this idea were true,<A
HREF="epm-n.html#7" target="n">{7}</A> the
experience would correctly be characterized as a seeing that x is
red.'
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus, our account implies that the three situations
<p>
<ol type=a>
<li> Seeing that x, over there, is red<br>
<li> Its looking to one that x, over there, is red<br>
<li> Its looking to one as though there were a red object over
there</ol>
<p>
differ primarily in that (a) is so formulated as to involve an
endorsement of the idea that x, over there, is red, whereas in
(b) this idea is only partially endorsed, and in (c) not at all.
Let us refer to the idea <i>that x, over there, is red</i> as the
<i>common propositional content</i> of these three situations. (This
is, of course, not strictly correct, since the propositional
content of (c) is <i>existential</i>, rather than about a
presupposedly designated object x, but it will serve my purpose.
Furthermore, the common propositional content of these three
experiences is much more complex and determinate than is
indicated by the sentence we use to describe our experience to
others, and which I am using to represent it. Nevertheless it is
clear that, subject to the first of these qualifications, the
propositional content of these three experiences <i>could</i> be
identical.)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The propositional content of these three experiences is, of
course, a part of that to which we are logically committed by
characterizing them as situations of these three kinds. Of the
remainder, as we have seen, part is a matter of the extent to
which this propositional content is endorsed. It is the residue
with which we are now concerned. Let us call this residue the
<i>descriptive content</i>. I can then point out that it is
implied by my account that not only the <i>propositional content</i>, but
also the <i>descriptive content</i> of these three experiences
may be identical. I shall suppose this to be the case, though
that there must be some factual difference in the <i>total</i>
situations is obvious.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, and this is the decisive point, in characterizing these
three experiences as, respectively, a <i>seeing that x, over
there, is red, its looking to one as though x, over there, were
red</i>, and <i>its looking to one as though there were a red
object over there</i>, we do not specify this common
<i>descriptive</i> content save <i>indirectly</i>, by implying
that <i>if the common propositional content were true</i>,<A
HREF="epm-n.html#8" target="n">{8}</A> then all these three
situations would be cases of
<i>seeing</i> that x, over there, is red. Both existential and
qualitative lookings are experiences that would be <i>seeings</i>
if their propositional contents were true.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thus, the very nature of &quot;looks talk&quot; is such as to raise
questions to which it gives no answer: What is the
<i>intrinsic</i> character of the common descriptive content of
these three experiences? and How are they able to have it in spite
of the fact that whereas in the case of (a) the perceiver must be
in the presence of a red object over there, in (b) the object
over there need not be red, while in (c) there need be no object
over there at all?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec23"></a>23. Now it is clear that if we were required to give a more
direct characterization of the common descriptive content of
these experiences, we would begin by trying to do so in terms of
the quality <i>red</i>. Yet, as I have already pointed out, we
can scarcely say that this descriptive content is itself
something red unless we can pry the term &quot;red&quot; loose from its
prima-facie tie with the category of physical objects. And there
is a line of thought which has been one of the standard gambits
of perceptual epistemology and which seems to promise exactly
this. If successful, it would convince us that <i>redness</i> -- in
the most basic sense of this term -- is a characteristic of items
of the sort we have been calling sense contents. It runs as
follows:
<p>
<blockquote>
While it would, indeed, be a howler to say that we don't see
chairs, tables, etc., but only their facing surfaces,
nevertheless, although we see a table, say, and although the
table has a back as well as a front, we do not see the back of
the table as we see its front. Again, although we see the table,
and although the table has an 'inside,' we do not see the inside
of the table as we see its facing outside. Seeing an object
entails seeing its facing surface. If we are seeing that an
object is red, this entails seeing that its facing surface is
red. A red surface is a two-dimensional red expanse -- two-dimensional in that though it may be <i>bulgy</i>, and in <i>this</i> sense three-dimensional, it has no <i>thickness</i>. As far
as the analysis of perceptual consciousness is concerned, a red
physical object is one that has a red expanse as its surface.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now a red expanse is not a physical object, nor does the
existence of a red expanse entail the existence of a physical
object to which it belongs. (Indeed, there are &quot;wild&quot; expanses
which do not belong to any physical object.) The &quot;descriptive
content&quot; -- as you put it -- which is common to the three experiences
(a), (b) and (c) above, is exactly this sort of thing, a bulgy
red expanse.
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Spelled out thus baldly, the fallacy is, or should be, obvious;
it is a simple equivocation on the phrase &quot;having a red surface.&quot;
We start out by thinking of the familiar fact that a physical
object may be of one color &quot;on the surface&quot; and of another color
&quot;inside.&quot; We may express this by saving that, for example, the
'surface' of the object is red. but its 'inside' green. But in
saying this we are <i>not</i> saying that there is a 'surface' in the
sense of a bulgy two-dimensional particular, a red 'expanse'
which is a component particular in a complex particular which
also includes green particulars. The notion of two-dimensional
bulgy (or flat) particulars is a product of philosophical (and
mathematical) sophistication which can be <i>related to</i> our
ordinary conceptual framework, but does not belong in an
<i>analysis</i> of it. I
think that in its place it has an important contribution to make.
(See below, <a href="epm16.html#sec61.5">Section 61, (5)</a>)  But this place is in
the logical space of an ideal <i>scientific</i> picture of the
world and
not in the logical space of ordinary discourse. It has nothing to
do with the logical grammar of our ordinary color words. It is
just a mistake to suppose that as the word &quot;red&quot; is actually
used, it is ever surfaces in the sense of two-dimensional
particulars which are red. The only particular involved when a
physical object is &quot;red on the outside, but green inside&quot; is the
physical object itself, located in a certain region of Space and
enduring over a stretch of Time. The fundamental grammar of the
attribute <i>red</i> is <i>physical object x is red at place p
and at time t</i>. Certainly, when we say of an object that it is
red, we commit ourselves to no more than that it is red &quot;at the
surface.&quot; And sometimes it is red at the surface by having what
we would not hesitate to call a &quot;part&quot; which is red through and
through -- thus, a red table which is red by virtue of a layer of
red paint. But the red paint is not itself red by virtue of a
component -- a 'surface' or 'expanse'; a particular with no
thickness -- which is red. There may, let me repeat, turn out to be
some place in the total philosophical picture for the statement
that there &quot;really are&quot; such particulars, and that they are
elements in perceptual experience. But this place is not to be
found by an analysis of ordinary perceptual discourse, any more
than Minkowski four-dimensional Space-Time worms are an
<i>analysis</i> of what we mean when we speak of physical objects
in Space and Time.
