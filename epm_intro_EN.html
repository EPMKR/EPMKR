The kind of philosophy we now call “analytic” started out as a form of empiricism. It developed out of the work of
Bertrand Russell, Rudolf Carnap, and others—the work summarized and put in canonical, easily teachable form by A. J.
Ayer in his <i>Language, Truth, and Logic</i> (1936). In that book, Ayer put forward the ideas which make up what we now call
“logical positivism” or “logical empiricism”—ideas which restated the foundationalist epistemology of British empiricism
in linguistic, as opposed to psychological, terms. These ideas are very different from those which underlie what is
sometimes called “post-positivistic” analytic philosophy—a brand of philosophy which is sometimes said to be “beyond”
empiricism and rationalism.

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The shift from the earlier to the later form of analytic philosophy, a shift which began around 1950 and was complete by
around 1970, was a result of many complexly interacting forces, the pattern of which is hard to trace. Nevertheless, any
historian of this shift would do well to focus on three seminal works: Willard van Orman Quine’s Two Dogmas of
Empiricism (1951), Ludwig Wittgenstein’s <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> (1954), and Wilfrid Sellars’s Empiricism and the
Philosophy of Mind (1956).
        

    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Of these three, Sellars’s long, complicated, and very rich essay is the least known and discussed. Historians of recent
    Anglo-American philosophy have emphasized the importance of Quine’s essay in raising doubts about the notion of
    “analytic truth” and thus about the Carnapian-Russellian notion that philosophy should be “the logical analysis of
    language.” They have also emphasized the importance of the work of the later Wittgenstein—especially what Strawson
    called his “hostility to immediacy,” his distrust of traditional empiricist explanations of the acquisition of
    knowledge. They have not, for the most part, given much weight to Sellars’s role in bringing about the collapse of
    sense-data empiricism. This is a pity, since Sellars’s attack on “the Myth of the Given” was, in America (though not in
    Britain), very influential in persuading philosophers that there was something deeply wrong with the sort of
    phenomenalism Ayer had advocated<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.

    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Wilfrid Sellars was born in 1912 and died in 1989. He taught philosophy at Minnesota, Yale, and finally at Pittsburgh.
                He published a great many essays, as well as one monograph, <i>Science and Metaphysics</i> (his Locke Lectures at Oxford in
                1967)<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. His work was often criticized for its obscurity. 
                This obscurity was partially a result of Sellars’s idiosyncratic
                style, but some of it was in the eye of the beholder. For Sellars was unusual among prominent American philosophers of
                the post–World War II period, and quite different from Quine and Wittgenstein, in having a wide and deep acquaintance
                with the history of philosophy<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>. This knowledge of previous philosophers kept 
                intruding into his work (as in the two
                rather cryptic chapters on Kant which open <i>Science and Metaphysics</i>), and helped to make his writings seem difficult for
                analytic philosophers whose education had been less historically oriented than Sellars’s. Sellars believed that
                “philosophy without the history of philosophy is, if not blind, at least dumb,” but this view seemed merely perverse to
                much of his audience.
          
    </p>

    <p>
    OF ALL SELLARS’S WRITINGS, "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind" is the most widely read and the most accessible.
    Indeed, this essay is all that most analytic philosophers know of Sellars. But it is almost enough, since it is the
    epitome of an entire philosophical system. It covers most of the aspects of Sellars’s overall project—the project he
    described as an attempt to usher analytic philosophy out of its Humean and into its Kantian stage.

    </p>



    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The fundamental thought which runs through this essay is Kant’s: “intuitions without concepts are blind.”
        Having a sense-impression is, by itself, an example neither of knowledge nor of conscious experience. Sellars, like the later
        Wittgenstein but unlike Kant, identified the possession of a concept with the mastery of the use of a word. So for him,
        mastery of a language is prerequisite of conscious experience.
        As he says in sect. 29: “all awareness of sorts, resemblances, facts, etc., in short all awareness of abstract
        entities—indeed, all awareness even of particulars—is a linguistic affair.”*
        This doctrine, which he called “psychological nominalism,” entails that Locke, Berkeley, and Hume were wrong in thinking
        that we are “aware of certain determinate sorts ... simply by virtue of having sensations and images” (sect. 28).

    </p>


    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Sellars’s argument for psychological nominalism is based on a claim which spells out the moral of many of the aphorisms
        of <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>:
        “The essential point is that in characterizing an episode or a state as that of <i>knowing</i>, we are not giving an empirical
        description of that episode or state; we are placing it in the logical space of reasons, of justifying and being able to
        justify what one says” (sect. 36).
        
        In other words, knowledge is inseparable from a social practice—the practice of justifying one’s assertions to one’s
        fellow-humans. It is not presupposed by this practice, but comes into being along with it.



    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So we cannot do what some logical positivists hoped to do: analyze epistemic facts without remainder “into non-epistemic
        facts, whether phenomenal or behavioral, public or private, with no matter how lavish a sprinkling of subjunctives and
        hypotheticals” (sect. 5)<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>. In particular, we cannot not perform such an analysis 
        by discovering the “foundation” of empirical knowledge in the objects of “direct
        acquaintance,” objects which are “immediately before the mind.”
        We cannot privilege reports that, for example, there is something red in the neighborhood as “reports of the immediately
        given.” For such reports are no less mediated by language, and thus by social practice, than reports that there are cows
        or electrons in the neighborhood.
        The whole idea of “foundations” of knowledge, basic to both empiricism and rationalism, disappears once we become
        psychological nominalists.
        
       

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Whereas Quine’s "Two Dogmas" had helped destroy the rationalist form of foundationalism by attacking the distinction
        between analytic and synthetic truths, "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind" helped destroy the empiricist form of
        foundationalism by attacking the distinction between what is “given to the mind” and what is “added by the mind.”
        Sellars’s attack on the Myth of the Given was a decisive move in turning analytic philosophy away from the
        foundationalist motives of the logical empiricists. It raised doubts about the very idea of “epistemology,” about the
        reality of the problems which philosophers had discussed under that heading<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>.
        
        One of the most quoted sentences in the essay occurs in sect. 38: “... empirical knowledge, like its sophisticated
        extension, science, is rational, not because it has a <i>foundation</i>, but because it is a self-correcting 
        enterprise which can put any
        claim in jeopardy, though not <i>all</i> at once."<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>
        This sentence suggests that rationality is a matter not of obedience to standards (which epistemologists might hope to
        codify), but rather of give-and-take participation in a cooperative social project.
        

        
    </p>
    <p>
    AN ELABORATION AND DEFENSE  of the presuppositions and implications of psychological nominalism, however, is not all
    there is to "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind". Sections 48–63 contain Sellars’s “Myth of Jones”—a story which
    explains why we can be naturalists without being behaviorists, why we can accept Wittgenstein’s doubts about what
    Sellars calls “self-authenticating non-verbal episodes” without sharing Ryle’s doubts about the existence of such mental
    entities as thoughts and sense-impressions.
    </p>

   

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At the time at which Sellars was writing, this was a vexed issue. For the appearance of Ryle’s <i>The Concept of Mind</i>
        (1949) shortly before that of the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> (1954) had made Wittgensteinian opposition to the idea of
        a “private language,” and to that of “entities capable of being known by only one person,” seem inseparable<sup id="t_fnref1"><a href="#t_fn1">1</a></sup> from Ryle’s
        polemic against “the ghost in the machine.” Sellars’s account of inner episodes as having originally been postulated,
        rather than observed, together with his account of how speakers might then come to make introspective reports (sect. 59)
        of such episodes, made clear how one could be Wittgensteinian without being Rylean.
        
        Sellars showed how one could give a non-reductive account of “mental event” while nevertheless eschewing, with
        Wittgenstein, the picture of the eye of the mind witnessing these events in a sort of immaterial inner theater.

    </p>



    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sellars’s treatment of the distinction between mind and body has been followed up by many philosophers of mind in
    subsequent decades. He may have been the first philosopher to insist that we see “mind” as a sort of hypostatization of
    language. He argued that the intentionality of beliefs is a reflection of the intentionality of sentences, rather than
    conversely<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>.
    This reversal makes it possible to understand mind as gradually entering the universe by and through the gradual
    development of language, as part of a naturalistically explicable evolutionary process, rather than seeing language as
    the outward manifestation of something inward and mysterious which humans have and animals lack. As Sellars sees it, if
    you can explain how the social practices we call “using language” came into existence, you have already explained all
    that needs to be explained about the relation between mind and world<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup>.

    </p>

    <p>
A RECENT BOOK  by Robert Brandom, <I>Making It Explicit</I><sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup>, 
offers the first systematic and comprehensive attempt to follow up
on Sellars’s thought<sup id="fnref10"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup>. More specifically, it offers
 a “semantic explanatory strategy which takes <I>inference</I> as its basic
concept,”<sup id="fnref11"><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup> as opposed to the alternative strategy—dominant since the Enlightenment—which takes <I>representation</I> as its
basic concept. Brandom’s work can usefully be seen as an attempt to usher analytic philosophy from its Kantian to its Hegelian stage --
an attempt foreshadowing in Sellars's wry description of "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind" as
 "incipient Meditations Hegeliennes"<sup id="fnref12"><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup>. 
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    From Hegel’s point of view, taking Kant’s point that intuitions without concepts are blind is the first step toward
    abandoning a bad philosophical habit which the British empiricists took over from Descartes—the habit of asking whether
    mind ever succeeds in making unmediated contact with the world, and remaining skeptical about the status of
    knowledge-claims until such contact can be shown to exist. That habit is characteristic of philosophers who, in
    Brandom’s terms, are “representationalist” (like Descartes and Locke) rather than “inferentialist” (like Leibniz, Kant,
    Frege, the later Wittgenstein, and Sellars). The former take concepts to be representations (or putative
    representations) of reality, rather than, as Kant did, rules which specify how something is to be done. Kant’s
    fundamental insight, Brandom says, “is that judgments and actions are to be understood to begin with in terms of the
    special way in which we are <I>responsible</I> for them.”<sup id="fnref13"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup>.

        
    </p>


    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    
    Following out this side of Kant’s thought, rather than the side which led him to the skeptical conclusion that we could
    have no knowledge of things as they are in themselves, means emphasizing the passages in Kant which anticipate Hegel,
    Marx, Dewey, and Habermas, as opposed to those which connect Kant with his predecessors. This is the side of the
    <I>Critique of Pure Reason</I> which links up with Kant’s “Project for a Universal History with Cosmopolitan Intent,” rather
    than with Leibniz and Hume.    
    
    </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I once took the liberty of asking Sellars, “If a man chooses to bind the spirit of Hegel in the fetters of Carnap, how
shall he find readers?” My question was prompted by the final section of "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind", one of
the few places where Sellars let himself go. In that section he offers a brief, but synoptic, vision of world history:


        <p class="indented-small">
        I have used a myth [of Jones] to kill a myth—the Myth of the Given. But is my myth really a myth? Or does the reader
        not recognize Jones as Man himself in the middle of his journey from the grunts and groans of the cave to the subtle and
        polymendimensional discourse of the drawing room, the laboratory, and the study, the language of Henry and William
        James, of Einstein and of the philosophers who, in their efforts to break out of discourse to an archē beyond discourse,
        have provided the most curious dimension of all?” (sect. 63)
        </p>

 </p>

   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This question serves to link the Myth of Jones to Hegel’s account, in the <i> Phenomenology</i>, of the transition from
    sense-perception to consciousness to self-consciousness—and, more generally, from Nature to Spirit—and also to Darwin’s
    amendments to that account. Sellars’s inclusion of Henry James<sup id="t_fnref2"> <a href="#t_fn2">t2 </a> </sup> as well as of Einstein reminds us of his justified
    suspicion of the science-worship which afflicted the early stages of analytic philosophy. The final clause serves as a
    rebuke to all those philosophers, from Plato to Ayer, who hoped to “break out of discourse,” and as a reminder that the
    moral of the essay as a whole is that, though there is no such archē, we are none the worse for that.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brandom begins, so to speak, where Sellars’s essay leaves off. His book makes good on a lot of what Sellars called his
“promissory notes,” and it ends with a description of “the complete and explicit interpretive equilibrium exhibited by a
community whose members adopt the explicit discursive stance toward each other”—an equilibrium Brandom identifies with
“social self-consciousness.” Brandom offers a vision of all language-users forming “one great Community comprising
members of all particular communities—the Community of those who say ‘we’ with and to someone,” whether the members of
those different particular communities recognize each other or not.

</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<
This sort of free and easy transition between philosophy of language and mind on the one hand, and world-historical
vision on the other, is reminiscent not only of Mead and Dewey but also of Gadamer and Habermas. Such transitions, as
well as Sellars’s and Brandom’s proto-Hegelianism, suggest that the Sellars-Brandom “social practice” approach to the
traditional topics of analytic philosophy might help reconnect that philosophical tradition with the so-called
“Continental” tradition.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Philosophers in non-anglophone countries typically think quite hard about Hegel, whereas the rather skimpy training in
the history of philosophy which most analytic philosophers receive often tempts them to skip straight from Kant to
Frege. It is agreeable to imagine a future in which the tiresome “analytic–Continental split” is looked back upon as an
unfortunate, temporary breakdown of communication—a future in which Sellars and Habermas, Davidson and Gadamer, Putnam
and Derrida, Rawls and Foucault, are seen as fellow-travelers on the same journey, fellow-citizens of what Michael
Oakeshott called a <I>civitas peregrina</I>.

        This reference to various attempted reductive analyses presupposes, as do many other passages in the essay, some 
        familiarity with the literature of analytic philosophy in 1940s and early 1950s -- e.g., 
        with Ayer's defenses of phenomenalism, Ryle's criticism of Descartes, and so on. Certain sections of Sellars' essay --e.g.
        , sections 8-9, and 231-23 -- may seem pointless excursus to those who lack such familiarity. But the overall argument of the essay
        is intelligible without reference to the particular figures whom Sellars discusses.

    I have offered a brief account of the roles of Quine and Sellars in persuading philosophers to abandon the atomism and
    foundationalism of Russell and Carnap in sec. 2 of Chapter IV of my <I>Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature</I> (1979).
    In that book I also urged that giving up foundationalism might cause us to abandon the idea that we needed a “theory of
    knowledge.” Recently Michael Williams—in his <I>Unnatural Doubts: Epistemological Realism and the Basis of Scepticism </I>
    (Cambridge, Mass. and Oxford:
    Blackwell, 1991)—has developed this theme much more thoroughly and carefully. He argues that it’s the unfortunate idea
    that there is a natural kind called “human knowledge” which gives rise to both foundationalism and Cartesian skepticism.
    Williams’s earlier book Groundless Belief (Blackwell, 1977)—an anti-foundationalist treatise which laid the foundations
    for Unnatural Doubts—was heavily influenced by Sellars.

        This insistence is most explicit in Sellars’s very instructive debate with Roderick Chisholm, reprinted as

        Minnesota Press, 1958).

This is only true, however, if, like Daniel Dennett and unlike Thomas Nagel, one does not think of “what it is like to
see something red” as referring to something quite different than does “having the disposition to call something red.”
To agree that Sellars dissolved the mind-body problem, one has to deny the existence of qualia. It is not clear that
Sellars would be on Dennett’s side of this issue, however, since he was tempted to think that what he called “the
scientific image of man” would be incomplete until we discover special new microstructural properties capable of
accounting for “the ultimate homogeneity” of phenomenological presentations. Be that as it may, Dennett has made clear
his own indebtedness to Sellars. See his <I>The Intentional Stance</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: Bradford Books, 1986). At p. 341
Dennett gives Sellars credit for originating functionalism, the school of thought in contemporary philosophy of mind to
which Dennett himself belongs. In a footnote on that page, Dennett remarks that “Sellars’s influence has been ubiquitous
but almost subliminal,” and at p. 349 he says, “Almost no one cites Sellars, while reinventing his wheels with
gratifying regularity.” This latter remark seems to me an accurate account of Sellars’s role in recent analytic
philosophy.

    Not all aspects of Sellars’s thought, however. Brandom sluffs off, for example, Sellars’s attempt to revive the

    well as his speculations about the need for science to develop microphysical concepts adequate to explain the
    phenomenology of perception. In this respect, Brandom stands to “Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind” as Davidson (who
    sluffs off what he calls Quine’s “adventitious philosophical puritanism”) stands to “Two Dogmas.” Both men cultivate
    their respective teacher’s central insight by stripping it of accidental accretions.

polemic against “the ghost in the machine.” Sellars’s account of inner episodes as having originally been postulated,

        “빨간 문단" 은 ‘멈춰서 깊이 숙고할’ (red) 문단을,
        "녹색 문단" 은 ‘크게 고민없이 읽을" (green) 문단을 비유적으로 지칭한다.
        “빨간 문단", "녹색 문단" 이라는 표현을 이런 의미로 쓴 것은 교통 신호에서 처럼,
        붉은색은 ‘위험·경고’를, 녹색은 ‘안전·진행’을 상징한다는 것에 근거한다.

        헨리 제임스는 인간의 의식과 지각에 대한 주제들을 탐구한 소설가이고
        감각함 (sensing)을 행위 (action)이 아닌 작용 (act) 로 간주하는 것은 셀러스 사상의
        결정적인 통찰중의 하나이다. 여기에 대해서는 EPM 제 2절과 각주 t2 를 참고하라.

        여기서 말하는 상속 메커니즘은 추론적 상속 메커니즘을 가리킨다. 즉,
        p라는 주장이 정당화되어 있고,
        p로부터 q가 타당한 추론 과정을 통해 도출된다면,
        q는 그 추론을 매개로 p의 정당화를 ‘상속’받아 정당화된다는 방식의 메커니즘을 뜻한다.

        번역 이슈:
        “without having to be justified” → “정당화될 필요 없이”: 이것은 정당화 과정을 거쳐야 할 필요가 없다는 것을
        말한다. “being justified” → "정당화된 상태".
        한국어에서는 “정당화된 상태” 가 “정당화 과정을 거친 상태” 뉘앙스가 강하게 느껴진다.
        “being justified” 도 문맥에 따라서 “정당화 과정을 거친 상태” 를 의미할 수 있지만,
        영어에서는 “justified” 라는 과거분사가 “already possessing justification” (이미 “정당화 지위를 가진”)
        이라는 형용사의 의미로 자주 쓰인다.

        양화사 전도 (quantifier inversion) 은 논리식. 예를 들어,
        ∀x∃bP(b,x) 에서 두 양화사의 순서를 바꾸어 ∃b∀xP(b,x) 로 만드는 것을 가리킨다. 해당 논리식의 구성에 따라 이 양화사 전도가
        논리식의 의미를 바꿀 수도 있고, 바꾸지 않을 수도 있다. 전자의 경우를 타당하지 않은 양화사 전도라고 한다.

        각 정당화 사슬의 종착점으로서 (비추론적으로) 정당화된 어떤 믿음이 존재한다는 진술은 다음과 같은 논리식으로 표현될 수 있다:
        <br>
        ∀x∃b [ C(x)→ B(b) ∧ Terminal(b,x) ∧ J(b)] <br>
        C(x): x는 정당화 사슬(chain of justifications)다. B(b): b는 믿음(belief)다. Terminal(b,x): 사슬 x의 종착점이 b이다.
        J(b): b는 비추론적 정당화 지위(positive justificatory status)를 갖는다.

        위 논리식은 참이다. 여기서 믿음 b 는 각 정당화 사슬에 따라 결정되는 <I>개별</I> 믿음이다. 그런데 데카르트가 한 말은 다음과 같이
        표현될 수 있는 것이다. <br>

        기본적 믿음 (basic beliefs)” 이라고 부를 수 있는 특별한 <I>종류></I>의 믿음, 즉 다른 모든 믿음들의 토대를
        이루는 그런 믿음의 있다. 이것은 논리식으로 다음과 같이 표현될 수 있다. <br>

        ∃b∀x[ C(x)→ B(b) ∧ Terminal(b,x) ∧ J(b)] <br>

        위 논리식은 참인 논리식의 양화사 전도로서 참이 아니다. 어떤 믿음 b가 존재해서 항상 모든 정당화 사슬 x 에 대해,
        B(b) ∧ Terminal(b,x) ∧ J(b)
        를 만족시킨다는 것과 각 정당화 사슬 x 에 대해, B(b) ∧ Terminal(b,x) ∧ J(b) 을 만족시키는 개별 믿음 b 가 존재한다는 것은 전혀 다른 말이다.

        여기서 맥락 (context) 는 앞선 문장에서 말한 정당화 사슬을 지칭한다. 두개의 맥락 A 와 B를 상정해 보자.
        맥락 A 가 회의주의적 철학 토론 일 경우,
        “나는 지금 테이블을 보고 있다” 라는 믿음은 인식론적으로 정당화되어야 하는 주장이다.
        왜냐하면 가령 “지금 꿈꾸고 있는 것은 아닌가?”, “환각이 아닌가?” 같은 철학적 의심이 제기되기 때문이다.
        반면, 맥락 B 가 일상적인 대화 상황일 경우,
        누군가가 “나는 지금 테이블을 보고 있어" 라고 말하면,
        이를 비추론적인 정당화 지위를 가지는 진술로 간주하는 것이 타당하다.
        즉, 같은 믿음이라도
        철학적 문맥에서는 정당화가 필요하고
        일상적 문맥에서는 정당자 역할을 할 수 있다.
        “정당화 지위”는 고정된 속성이 아니라, 담론 상황 속에서 규정되는 기능적 개념인 것이다.

        세계 인구 통계에 따르면 전 세계에서 초당 약 4.3 건의 출산이 발생한다(즉, 매 분당 4.3×60≒258건)
    <div https://www.livepopulation.com/?utm_source="chatgpt.com"></div>
    따라서 각 분당, 전 세계 어딘가에는 반드시 “출산 중인 여성”이 존재한다는 말은
    통계적으로 당연히 참이 된다.
