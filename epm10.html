45. Let us now return, after a long absence, to the problem of
how the similarity among the experiences of <i>seeing that an
object over there is red, its looking to one that an object over
there is red</i> (when in point of fact it is <i>not</i> red) and
<i>its looking to one as though there were a red object over
there</i> (when in fact there is <i>nothing</i> over there at
all) is to be understood. Part of this similarity, we saw,
consists in the fact that they all involve the idea -- the
proposition, if you please -- that the object over there is red.
But over and above this there is, of course, the aspect which
many philosophers have attempted to clarify by the notion of
<i>impressions</i> or <i>immediate experience</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was pointed out in <a href="epm4.html#sec21">Sections 21</a> ff. above that there are prima
facie two ways in which facts of the form <i>x merely looks
red</i> might be explained, in addition to the kind of
explanation which is based on empirical generalizations relating
the color of objects, the circumstances in which they are seen,
and the colors they look to have. These two ways are (a)
the introduction of impressions or immediate experiences as
theoretical entities; and (b) the <i>discovery</i>, on
scrutinizing these situations, that they contain impressions or
immediate experiences as components. I called attention to the
paradoxical character of the first of these alternatives, and
refused, at that time, to take it seriously. But in the meantime
the second alternative, involving as it does the Myth of the
Given, has turned out to be no more satisfactory.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For, in the first place, how are these impressions to be
described, if not by using such words as &quot;red&quot; and &quot;triangular.&quot;
Yet, if my argument, to date, is sound, physical objects alone
can be literally red and triangular. Thus, in the cases I am
considering, there is nothing to be red and triangular. It would
seem to follow that &quot;impression of a red triangle&quot; could mean
nothing more than &quot;impression of <i>the sort which</i> is common
to those experiences in which we either see that something is red
and triangular, or something merely looks red and triangular, or
there merely looks to be a red and triangular object over there.&quot;
And if we can never characterize &quot;impressions&quot; intrinsically, but
only by what is logically a definite description, i.e., as <i>the
kind of entity which</i> is common to such situations, then we
would scarcely seem to be any better off than if we maintained
that talk about &quot;impressions&quot; is a notational convenience, a
code, for the language in which we speak of how things look and
what there looks to be.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And this line of thought is reinforced by the consideration that
once we give up the idea that we begin our sojourn in this world
with any -- even a vague, fragmentary, and undiscriminating -- 
awareness of the logical space of particulars, kinds, facts, and
resemblances, and recognize that even such &quot;simple&quot; concepts as
those of colors are the fruit of a long process of publicly
reinforced responses to public objects (including verbal
performances) in public situations, we may well be puzzled as to
how, even if there are such things as impressions or sensations,
we could come to know that there are, and to know what sort of
thing they are. <i>For we now recognize that instead of coming to
have a concept of something because we have noticed that sort of
thing, to have the ability to notice a sort of thing is already
to have the concept of that sort of thing, and cannot account for
it</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indeed, once we think this line of reasoning through, we are
struck by the fact that if it is sound, we are faced not only
with the question &quot;How could we come to have the idea of an
'impression' or 'sensation?'&quot; but by the question &quot;How could we
come to have the idea of something's looking red to us,&quot; or, to
get to the crux of the matter, &quot;of seeing that something is red?&quot;
In short, we are brought face to face with the general problem of
understanding how there can be <i>inner episodes</i> -- episodes,
that is, which somehow combine <i>privacy</i>, in that each of us
has privileged access to his own, with <i>intersubjectivity</i>,
in that each of us can, in principle, know about the other's. We
might try to put this more linguistically as the problem of how
there can be a sentence (e.g. &quot;S has a toothache&quot;) of which it is
<i>logically</i> true that whereas <i>anybody</i> can use it to
state a fact, only <i>one</i> person, namely S himself, can use
it to make a report. But while this is a useful formulation, it
does not do justice to the supposedly <i>episodic</i> character
of the items in question. And that this is the heart of the
puzzle is shown by the fact that many philosophers who would not
deny that there are short-term hypothetical and mongrel
hypothetical-categorical facts about behavior which others can
ascribe to us on behavioral evidence, but which only <i>we</i>
can <i>report</i>, have found it to be logical nonsense to speak
of non-behavioral <i>episodes</i> of which this is true. Thus, it
has been claimed by Ryle<A HREF="epm-n.html#14" target="n">{14}</A>
that the very idea that there are such episodes is a category
mistake, while others have argued that though there are such
episodes, they cannot be characterized in intersubjective
discourse, learned as it is in a context of
public objects and in the 'academy' of one's linguistic peers. It
is my purpose to argue that both these contentions are quite
mistaken, and that not only are inner episodes <i>not</i>
category mistakes, they are quite &quot;effable&quot; in intersubjective
discourse. And it is my purpose to show, positively, <i>how</i>
this can be the case. I am particularly concerned to make this
point in connection with such inner episodes as sensations and
feelings, in short, with what has -- unfortunately, I think -- been
called immediate experience.&quot; For such an account is necessary to
round off this examination of the Myth of the Given. But before I
can come to grips with these topics, the way must be prepared by
a discussion of inner episodes of quite another kind, namely
<i>thoughts</i>.
