<a name="sec10"></a>10. Before turning aside to examine the suggestion that the
language of sense data is &quot;another language&quot; for the situations
described by the so-called &quot;language of appearing,&quot; I had
concluded that classical sense datum theories, when pressed,
reveal themselves to be the result of a mismating of two ideas:
(1) The idea that there are certain &quot;inner episodes,&quot; e.g. the
sensation of a red triangle or of a C# sound, which occur to
human beings and brutes without any prior process of learning or
concept formation, and without which it would -- in <i>some</i>
sense -- be impossible to see, for example, that the facing surface
of a physical object is red and triangular, or <i>hear</i> that a
certain physical sound is C#. (2) The idea that there are certain
&quot;inner episodes&quot; which are the non-inferential knowings that, for
example, a certain item is red and triangular, or, in the case of
sounds, C#, which inner episodes are the necessary conditions of
empirical knowledge as providing the evidence for all other
empirical propositions. If this diagnosis is correct, a
reasonable next step would be to examine these two ideas and
determine how that which survives criticism in each is properly
to be combined with the other. Clearly we would have to come to
grips with the idea of <i>inner episodes</i>, for this is common
to both.

    <a name="sec10"></a>10. 감각 자료의 언어가 소위 “나타남(appearing)의 언어” 로 묘사되는 상황에 대한 “다른 언어”라는
     제안을 살펴보기 전에, 고전적 감각-자료 이론은 면밀히
    파고들어 보면 다음 두 가지 아이디어가 잘못 결합된 결과라는 것을 스스로 드러낸다고  결론 지었다. 
    (1) 특정 “내적 사건” 들 — 예컨대 빨간 삼각형의 감각이나 C# 음의 감각— 이 인간과 동물에게 학습이나 개념 형성 과정 없이
    일어나며, 이러한 사건이 없이는, 예를 들어 물리적 사물의 마주보는 면이 빨갛고 삼각형이라는 것을 <i>보거나</i>, 어떤 물리적 소리가 C#이라는 것을 <i>듣는</i> 것이 <i>어떤 의미에서</i>
    불가능하다는 생각. (2) 특정 “내적 사건”들이, 예를 들어 어떤 대상이 빨갛고 삼각형이라는 사실, 혹은 소리의 경우에는 C#이라는 사실을 비추론적으로 아는 것(non-inferential
    knowings)이라는 생각으로, 이러한 내적 사건들이 다른 모든 경험적 명제를 위한 증거를 제공함으로써 경험적 지식의 필수 조건이 된다는 것이다.

    만약 이 진단이 옳다면, 다음으로 합리적인 단계는 이 두 아이디어를 검토하여 각각의 비판을 거친 후에도 살아남는 요소들이 상호 간에 어떻게 올바르게 결합되어야 하는지를 결정하는 일일 것이다. 분명한 것은, 두
    아이디어 모두에 공통적으로 등장하는 <i>내적 사건들</i> 개념을 제대로 파악해야 한다는 점이다.

    <a name="sec10"></a>10. 감각 자료 언어가 이른바 "나타나는 언어 (language of appearing)" 로 
    설명되는 상황에 대한 "다른 언어" 라는 제안을 검토하기에 앞서, 
    나는 고전적인 감각 자료 이론들이 압박을 받을 때 두
    가지 아이디어의 잘못된 결합의 결과임을 드러낸다고 결론지었다: (1) 어떤 "내적 에피소드"가 존재한다는 생각, 예를 들어 빨간 삼각형의 감각이나 C# 소리의 감각이 인간과 짐승에게 학습이나 개념 형성의 사전
    과정 없이 발생하며, 그렇지 않으면 어떤 의미에서 물리적 객체의 정면 표면이 빨갛고 삼각형이라는 것을 보거나, 특정 물리적 소리가 C#이라는 것을 들을 수 없다는 생각. (2) 특정 항목이 빨갛고 삼각형이라는
    것을 아는 비추론적 인식, 또는 소리의 경우 C#이라는 것을 아는 "내적 에피소드"가 존재한다는 생각, 이러한 내적 에피소드는 모든 다른 경험적 명제에 대한 증거를 제공함으로써 경험적 지식의 필수 조건이다.
    이 진단이 맞다면, 다음으로 합리적인 단계는 이 두 가지 아이디어를 검토하고 각 아이디어에서 비판을 견디는 것이 어떻게 다른 것과 적절히 결합될 수 있는지를 결정하는 것이다. 분명히 우리는 <i>내적
        에피소드</i>라는 개념과 씨름해야 할 것이며, 이는 두 가지 모두에 공통적이다.


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many who attack the idea of the given seem to have thought that
the central mistake embedded in this idea is exactly the idea
that there are inner episodes, whether thoughts or so-called
&quot;immediate experiences,&quot; to which each of us has privileged
access. I shall argue that this is just not so, and that the Myth
of the Given can be dispelled without resorting to the crude
verificationisms or operationalisms characteristic of the more
dogmatic forms of recent empiricism. Then there are those who,
while they do not reject the idea of inner episodes, find the
Myth of the Given to consist in the idea that knowledge of these
episodes furnishes <i>premises</i> on which empirical knowledge
rests as
on a foundation. But while this idea has, indeed, been the most
widespread form of the Myth, it is far from constituting its
essence. Everything hinges on <i>why</i> these philosophers
reject it.
If, for example, it is on the ground that the learning of a
language is a <i>public</i> process which proceeds in a domain of
<i>public</i> objects and is governed by <i>public</i> sanctions,
so that <i>private</i> episodes -- with the exception of a
mysterious nod in their direction -- must needs escape the net of
rational discourse, then, while these philosophers are immune to
the form of the myth which has flowered in sense-datum theories,
they have no defense against the myth in the form of the
givenness of such facts as that <i>physical object x looks red to
person S at time t</i>, or that <i>there looks to person S at
time t to be a red physical object over there</i>. It will be
useful to pursue the Myth in this direction for a while before
more general issues are raised.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec11"></a>11. Philosophers have found it easy to suppose that such a
sentence as &quot;The tomato looks red to Jones&quot; says that a certain
triadic relation, <i>looking</i> or <i>appearing</i>, obtains
among a physical object, a person, and a quality.<A
HREF="epm-n.html#2" target="n">{2}</A> &quot;A looks
<font face="symbol">f</font> to S&quot; is assimilated to &quot;x gives y to z&quot; -- or, better,
since giving is, strictly speaking, an action rather than a
relation -- to &quot;x is between y and z,&quot; and taken to be a case of
the general form &quot;R(x,y,z).&quot; Having supposed this, they turn
without further ado to the question, &quot;Is this relation
analyzable?&quot; Sense-datum theorists have, on the whole, answered
&quot;Yes,&quot; and claimed that facts of the form <i>x looks red to X</i>
are to be analyzed in terms of sense data. Some of them, without
necessarily rejecting this claim, have argued that facts of this
kind are, at the very least, to be <i>explained</i> in terms of
sense data. Thus, when Broad<A HREF="epm-n.html#3" target="n">{3}</A>
writes &quot;If, in fact, nothing
elliptical is before my mind, it is very hard to understand why
the penny should seem <i>elliptical</i> rather than of any other
shape (p. 240),&quot; he is appealing to sense-data as a means of
<i>explaining</i> facts of this form. The
difference, of course, is that whereas if <i>x looks <font face="symbol">f</font> to
S</i> is correctly <i>analyzed</i> in terms of sense data, then
no one could believe that x looks <font face="symbol">f</font> to S without
believing that S has sense data, the same need not be true if
<i>x looks <font face="symbol">f</font> to S</i> is explained in terms of sense data,
for, in the case of some types of explanation, at least, one can
believe a fact without believing its explanation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the other hand, those philosophers who reject sense-datum
theories in favor of so-called theories of appearing have
characteristically held that facts of the form <i>x looks
<font face="symbol">f</font> to S</i> are ultimate and irreducible, and that sense
data are needed neither for their analysis nor for their
explanation. If asked, &quot;Doesn't the statement 'x looks red to S'
have as part of its meaning the idea that S stands in some
relation to something that <i>is</i> red?&quot; their answer is in the
negative, and, I believe, rightly so.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<a name="sec12"></a>12. I shall begin my examination of &quot;X looks red to S at t&quot; with
the simple but fundamental point that the sense of &quot;red&quot; in which
things <i>look</i> red is, on the face of it, the same as that in
which things <i>are</i> red. When one glimpses an object and
decides that it looks red (to <i>me</i>, <i>now</i>, from here)
and wonders whether it really <i>is</i> red, one is surely
wondering whether the color -- red -- which it looks to have is the
one it really does have. This point can be obscured by such
verbal manipulations as hyphenating the words &quot;looks&quot; and &quot;red&quot;
and claiming that it is the insoluble unit &quot;looks-red&quot; and not
just &quot;looks&quot; which is the relation. Insofar as this dodge is
based on insight, it is insight into the fact that <i>looks</i>
is not a relation between a person, a thing, and a quality.
Unfortunately, as we shall see, the reason for this fact is one
which gives no comfort at all to the idea that it is
<i>looks-red</i> rather than <i>looks</i> which is the
relation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have, in effect, been claiming that <i>being red</i> is
logically prior, is a logically simpler notion, than <i>looking
red</i>; the function &quot;x is red&quot; to &quot;x looks red to y.&quot; In short,
that it just won't do to say that <i>x is red</i> is analyzable
in terms of <i>x looks red to y</i>. But what, then, are we to
make of the necessary truth -- and it is, of course, a necessary
truth -- that 
<p>
<center><table border=0 width=70%><tr valign=top><td><b>x&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;red</b><td><b>.</b><b>&lt;--&gt;</b> <b>.</b><td><b> x would <i>look</i> red to standard observers in standard conditions?</b>
</tr></table></center>
<p>
There is certainly some sense to the idea that this is at least
the schema for a definition of <i>physical redness</i> in terms
of <i>looking red</i>. One begins to see the plausibility of the
gambit that <i>looking-red</i> is an insoluble unity, for the minute one
gives &quot;red&quot; (on the right-hand side) an independent status, it
becomes what it obviously is, namely &quot;red&quot; as a predicate of
physical objects, and the supposed definition becomes an obvious
circle.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec13"></a>13. The way out of this troubling situation has two parts. The
<i>second</i> is to show how &quot;x <i>is</i> red&quot; can be necessarily
equivalent to &quot;x would <i>look</i> red to standard observers in
standard situations&quot; without this being a definition of &quot;x is
red&quot; in terms of &quot;x looks red.&quot; But the <i>first</i>, and
logically prior, step is to show that &quot;x looks red to S&quot; does not
assert either an unanalyzable triadic relation to obtain between
x, red, and S, or an unanalyzable dyadic relation to obtain
between x and S. Not, however, because it asserts an
<i>analyzable</i> relation to obtain, but because <i>looks</i> is
not a relation at all. Or, to put the matter in a familiar way,
one can say that <i>looks</i> is a relation if he likes, for the
sentences in which this word appears show some grammatical
analogy to sentences built around words which we should not
hesitate to classify as relation words; but once one has become
aware of certain other features which make them very unlike
ordinary relation sentences, he will be less inclined to view his
task as that of <i>finding the answer</i> to the question &quot;Is
looks a relation?&quot;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec14"></a>14. To bring out the essential features of the use of &quot;looks,&quot; I
shall engage in a little historical fiction. A young man, whom I
shall call John, works in a necktie shop. He has learned the use
of color words in the usual way, with this exception. I shall
suppose that he has never looked at an object in other than
standard conditions. As he examines his stock every evening
before closing up shop, he says, &quot;This is red,&quot; &quot;That is green,&quot;
&quot;This is purple,&quot; etc., and such of his linguistic peers as
happen to be present nod their heads approvingly.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let us suppose, now, that at this point in the story, electric
lighting is invented. His friends and neighbors rapidly adopt
this new means of illumination, and wrestle with the problems it
presents. John, however, is the last to succumb. Just after it
has been installed in his shop, one of his neighbors, Jim, comes
in to buy a necktie.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Here is a handsome green one,&quot; says John.
<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But it <i>isn't</i> green,&quot; says Jim, and takes John
outside.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; says John, &quot;it was green in there, but now it is
blue.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No,&quot; says Jim, &quot;you know that neckties don't change their color merely as a result of being taken from place to place.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But perhaps electricity changes their color and they change
back again in daylight?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That would be a queer kind of change, wouldn't it?&quot; says
Jim.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I suppose so,&quot; says bewildered John. &quot;But we <i>saw</i> that it was green <i>in there</i>.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, we didn't see that it was green in there, because it wasn't
green, and you can't see what isn't so!&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well, this is a pretty pickle,&quot; says John. &quot;<i>I just don't know what to say</i>.&quot;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The next time John picks up this tie in his shop and someone asks
what color it is, his first impulse is to say &quot;It is green.&quot; He
suppresses this impulse, and remembering what happened before,
comes out with &quot;It is blue.&quot; He doesn't <i>see</i> that it is
blue, nor
would he say that he sees it to be blue. What does he see? Let us
ask him.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't know <i>what</i> to say. If I didn't know that the tie is
blue -- 
and the alternative to granting this is odd indeed -- I would swear
that I was seeing a green tie and seeing that it is green. It is
<i>as though</i> I were seeing the necktie to be green.&quot;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If we bear in mind that such sentences as &quot;This is green&quot; have
both a <i>fact-stating</i> and a <i>reporting</i> use, we can put
the point I
have just been making by saying that once John learns to stifle
the <i>report</i> &quot;This necktie is green&quot; when looking at it in
the shop, there is no other <i>report</i> about color and the
necktie which he knows how to make. To be sure, he now says &quot;This
necktie is blue.&quot; But he is not making a <i>reporting</i> use of
this sentence. He uses it as the conclusion of an
inference.<A HREF="epm-n.html#4" target="n">{4}</A>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec15"></a>15. We return to the shop after an interval, and we find that
when John is asked &quot;What is the color of this necktie?&quot; he makes
such statements as &quot;It looks green, but take it outside and see.&quot;
It occurs to us that perhaps in learning to say &quot;This tie
<i>looks</i> green&quot; when in the shop, he has learned to make a
new kind of report. Thus, it might seem as though his linguistic
peers have helped him to notice a new kind of <i>objective</i>
fact, one which, though a relational fact involving a perceiver,
is as logically independent of the beliefs, the conceptual
framework of the perceiver, as the fact that the necktie is blue;
but a <i>minimal</i> fact, one which it is safer to report
because one is less likely to be mistaken. Such a minimal fact
would be the fact that the necktie looks green to John on a
certain occasion, and it would be properly reported by using the
sentence &quot;This necktie <i>looks</i> green.&quot; It is this type of
account, of course, which I have already rejected.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But what is the alternative? If, that is, we are not going to
adopt the sense-datum analysis. Let me begin by noting that there
certainly seems to be something to the idea that the sentence
&quot;This looks green to me now&quot; has a reporting role. Indeed, it
would seem to be essentially a report. But if so, <i>what</i> does it
report, if not a minimal objective fact, and if what it reports
is not to be analyzed in terms of sense data?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec16"></a>16. Let me next call attention to the fact that the experience of
having something look green to one at a certain time is, insofar
as it is an experience, obviously very much like that of seeing
something to be green, insofar as the latter is an experience.
But the latter, of course, is not <i>just</i> an experience. And
this is the heart of the matter. For to say that a certain
experience is a <i>seeing that</i> something is the case, is to
do more than describe the experience. It is to characterize it
as, so to speak, making an assertion or claim, and -- which is the
point I wish to stress -- to <i>endorse</i> that claim. As a matter
of fact, as we shall see, it is much more easy to see that the
statement &quot;Jones sees that the tree is green&quot; ascribes a
propositional claim to Jones' experience and endorses it, than to
specify how the statement <i>describes</i> Jones' experience.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I realize that by speaking of experiences as containing
propositional claims. I may seem to be knocking at closed doors.
I ask the reader to bear with me, however, as the justification
of this way of talking is one of my major aims. If I am permitted
to issue this verbal currency now, I hope to put it on the gold
standard before concluding the argument.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec16"></a>16. It is clear that the experience of seeing that something is
green is not <i>merely</i> the occurrence of the propositional
claim
'this is green' -- not even if we add, as we must, that this claim
is, so to speak, evoked or wrung from the perceiver by the object
perceived. Here Nature -- to turn Kant's simile (which he uses in
another context) on its head -- puts us to the question. The
something more is clearly what philosophers have in mind when
they speak of &quot;visual impressions&quot; or &quot;immediate visual
experiences.&quot; What exactly is the logical status of these
&quot;impressions&quot; or &quot;immediate experiences&quot; is a problem which will
be with us for the remainder of this argument. For the moment it
is the propositional claim which concerns us.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I pointed out above that when we use the word &quot;see&quot; as in &quot;S sees
that the tree is green&quot; we are not only ascribing a claim to the
experience, but endorsing it. It is this endorsement which Ryle
has in mind when he refers to <i>seeing that something is thus
and so</i> as an <i>achievement</i>, and to &quot;sees&quot; as an
<i>achievement word</i>. I prefer to call it a &quot;so it is&quot; or
&quot;just so&quot; word, for the root idea is that of <i>truth</i>. To
characterize S's experience as a <i>seeing</i> is, in a suitably
broad sense -- which I shall be concerned to explicate -- to apply
the semantical concept of truth to that experience.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now the suggestion I wish to make is, in its simplest terms, that
the statement &quot;X looks green to Jones&quot; differs from &quot;Jones sees
that x is green&quot; in that whereas the latter both ascribes a
propositional claim to Jones' experience <i>and endorses it</i>,
the former ascribes the claim but does not endorse it. This is
the essential difference between the two, for it is clear that
two experiences may be identical <i>as experiences</i>, and yet
one be properly referred to as a <i>seeing that</i> something is
green, and the other <i>merely</i> as a case of something's
<i>looking</i> green. Of course, if I say &quot;X <i>merely looks</i>
green to S&quot; I am not only failing to endorse the claim, I am
rejecting it.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Thus, when I say &quot;X looks green to me now&quot; I am
<i>reporting</i> the fact that my experience is, so to speak,
intrinsically, <i>as an experience</i>, indistinguishable from a
veridical one of seeing that x is green. Involved in the report
is the ascription to my experience of the claim 'x is green'; 
and the fact that I make this report rather than the simple
report &quot;X is green&quot; indicates that certain considerations have
operated to raise, so to speak in a higher court, the question
'to endorse or not to endorse.' I may have reason to think that x
may not after all be green.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If I make at one time the report &quot;X looks to be green&quot; -- which is 
not only a report, but the withholding of an endorsement -- I may
later, when the original reasons for withholding endorsement have
been rebutted, endorse the original claim by saying &quot;I saw that
it was green, though at the time I was only sure that it looked
green.&quot; Notice that I will only say &quot;I see that x is green&quot; (as
opposed to &quot;X is green&quot;) when the question &quot;to endorse or not to
endorse&quot; has come up. &quot;I see that x is green&quot; belongs, so to
speak, on the same level as &quot;X looks green&quot; and &quot;X merely
<i>looks</i> green.&quot;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec17"></a>17. There are many interesting and subtle questions about the
dialectics of &quot;looks talk,&quot; into which I do not have the space to
enter.  Fortunately, the above distinctions suffice for our
present purposes. Let us suppose, then, that to say that &quot;X looks
green to S at t&quot; is, in effect, to say that S has that kind of
experience which, if one were prepared to endorse the
propositional claim it involves, one would characterize as
<i>seeing x to be green at t</i>. Thus, when our friend John
learns to use the sentence &quot;This necktie looks green to me&quot; he
learns a way of reporting an experience of the kind which, as far
as any categories I have yet permitted him to have are concerned,
he can only characterize by saying that as an experience it does
not differ from seeing something to be green, and that evidence
for the proposition 'This necktie is green' is <i>ipso facto</i>
evidence for the proposition that the experience in question is
<i>seeing that the necktie is green</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now one of the chief merits of this account is that it permits a
parallel treatment of 'qualitative' and 'existential' seeming or
looking. Thus, when I say &quot;The tree looks bent&quot; I am endorsing
that part of the claim involved in my experience which concerns
the existence of the tree, but withholding endorsement from the
rest. On the other hand, when I say &quot;There looks to be a bent
tree over there&quot; I am refusing to endorse any but the most
general aspect of the claim, namely, that there is an 'over
there' as opposed to a 'here.' Another merit of the account is
that it explains how a necktie, for example, can look red to S at
t, without looking scarlet or crimson or any other determinate
shade of red. In short it explains how things can have a
<i>merely generic</i> look, a fact which would be puzzling indeed
if looking
red were a <i>natural</i> as opposed to [an] <i>epistemic</i>
fact about
objects. The core of the explanation, of course, is that the
propositional claim involved in such an experience may be, for
example, either the more determinable claim 'This is red' or the
more determinate claim 'This is crimson.' The complete story is
more complicated, and requires some account of the role in these
experiences of the 'impressions' or 'immediate experiences' the
logical status of which remains to be determined. But even in the
absence of these additional details, we can note the resemblance
between the fact that x can look red to S, without it being true
of some specific shade of red that x looks to S to be of that
shade, and the fact that S can believe that Cleopatra's Needle is
tall, without its being true of some determinate number of feet
that S believes it to be that number of feet tall.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec18"></a>18. The point I wish to stress at this time, however, is that the
concept of <i>looking green</i>, the ability to recognize that
something <i>looks green</i>, presupposes the concept of <i>being
green</i>, and that the latter concept involves the ability to
tell what colors objects have by looking at them -- which, in turn,
involves knowing in what circumstances to place an object if one
wishes to ascertain its
color by looking at it. Let me develop this latter point. As our
friend John becomes more and more sophisticated about his own and
other people's visual experiences, he learns under what
conditions it is as though one were seeing a necktie to be of one
color when in fact it is of another. Suppose someone asks him
&quot;Why does this tie look green to me?&quot; John may very well reply
&quot;Because it is blue, and blue objects look green in this kind of
light.&quot; And if someone asks this question when looking at the
necktie in plain daylight, John may very well reply &quot;Because the
tie is green&quot; -- to which he may add &quot;We are in plain daylight,
<i>and in daylight things look what they are</i>.&quot; We thus see
that
<p>
<center><table border=0 width=70%><tr valign=top>
<td><b>x&nbsp;is&nbsp;red</b><td><b>.</b><b>&lt;--&gt;</b> <b>.</b><td> <b>x looks red to standard
observers in standard conditions</b></tr></table></center>
<p>
is a necessary truth <i>not</i> because the right-hand side is
the
definition of &quot;x is red,&quot; but because &quot;standard conditions&quot; means
condition in which things look what they are. And, of course,
<i>which</i> conditions are standard for a given mode of
perception is,
at the common-sense level specified by a list of conditions which
exhibit the vagueness and open texture characteristic of ordinary
discourse.<A HREF="epm-n.html#5" target="n">{5}</A>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec19"></a>
19. I have arrived at a stage in my argument which is, at least
prima facie, out of step with the basic presuppositions of
logical atomism. Thus, as long as <i>looking green</i> is taken
to be the notion to which <i>being green</i> is reducible, it
could be claimed with considerable plausibility that fundamental
concepts pertaining to observable fact have that logical
independence of one another which is characteristic of the
empiricist tradition. Indeed, at first sight the situation is
<i>quite</i> disquieting, for if the ability to recognize that x
looks green presupposes the concept of <i>being green</i>, and if
this in turn involves knowing in what circumstances to view an
object to ascertain its color, then, since one can scarcely
determine what the circumstances are without noticing that
certain objects have certain perceptible
characteristics -- including colors -- it would seem that one
couldn't form the concept of <i>being green</i>, and, by parity
of reasoning, of the other colors, unless he already had them.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, it just won't do to reply that to have the concept of green,
to know what it is for something to be green, it is sufficient to
respond when one is <i>in point of fact</i> in standard
conditions, to green objects with the vocable &quot;This is green.&quot;
Not only must the conditions be of a sort that is appropriate for
determining the color of an object by looking, the subject must
<i>know</i> that
conditions of this sort <i>are</i> appropriate. And while this
does not
imply that one must have concepts before one has them, it does
imply that one can have the concept of green only by having a
whole battery of concepts of which it is one element. It implies
that while the process of acquiring the concept of green may -- indeed does -- involve a long history of acquiring
<i>piecemeal</i>
habits of response to various objects in various circumstances,
there is an important sense in which one has <i>no</i> concept
pertaining to the observable properties of physical objects in
Space and Time unless one has them all -- and, indeed, as we shall
see, a great deal more besides.<A HREF="epm-n.html#6" target="n">{6}</A>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec20"></a>20. Now, I think it is clear what a logical atomist, supposing
that he found any merit at all in the above argument, would say.
He would say that I am overlooking the fact that the logical
space of physical objects in Space and Time rests on the logical
space of sense contents, and he would argue that it is concepts
pertaining to sense contents which have the logical independence
of one another which is characteristic of traditional empiricism.
&quot;After all,&quot; he would point out, &quot;concepts pertaining to
theoretical entities -- molecules, for example -- have the mutual
dependence you have, perhaps rightly, ascribed to concepts
pertaining to <i>physical</i> fact. But,&quot; he would continue,
&quot;theoretical concepts have empirical content because they rest
on -- are coordinated with -- a more fundamental logical space. Until
you have disposed, therefore, of the idea that there is a more
fundamental logical space than that of physical objects in Space
and Time, or shown that it too is fraught with coherence, your
incipient <i>Meditations Hegeliennes</i> are premature.&quot;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And we can imagine a sense-datum theorist to interject the
following complaint: &quot;You have begun to write as though you had
shown not only that <i>physical redness</i> is not to be analyzed
in
terms of <i>looking red</i> -- which I will grant -- but also that
physical redness is not to be analyzed at all, and, in
particular, not to be analyzed in terms of the redness of red
sense contents. Again, you have begun to write as though you had
shown not only that observing that x <i>looks</i> red is not more
basic than observing that x <i>is</i> red, but also that there is
<i>no</i> form of visual noticing more basic than seeing that x
is red, such as the sensing of a red sense content. I grant,&quot; he
continues, &quot;that the tendency of sense-datum theorists has been
to claim that the <i>redness</i> of physical objects is to be
analyzed in terms of <i>looking red</i>, and <i>then</i> to claim
that <i>looking red</i> is itself to be analyzed in terms of
<i>red sense contents</i>, and that you may have undercut this
line of analysis. But what is to prevent the sense-datum theorist
from taking the line that the properties of physical objects are
<i>directly</i> analyzable into the qualities and phenomenal
relations of sense contents?&quot;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Very well. But once again we must ask, How does the sense-datum
theorist come by the framework of sense contents? and How is he
going to convince us that there are such things? For even if
<i>looking red</i> doesn't enter into the analysis of physical
redness, it is by asking us to reflect on the experience of
having something look red to us that he hopes to make this
framework convincing. And it therefore becomes relevant to note
that my analysis of <i>x looks red to S at t</i> has not, at
least as far as I have pushed it to date, revealed any such items
as sense-contents. And it may be relevant to suggest that once we
see clearly that physical redness is not to be given a
dispositional analysis in terms of <i>looking red</i>, the idea
that it is to be given <i>any</i> kind of dispositional analysis
loses a large measure of its plausibility. In any event, the next
move must be to press further the above account of qualitative
and existential looking.
