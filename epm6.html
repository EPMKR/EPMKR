<p>
<a name="sec26"></a>26. There are those who will say that although I have spoken of
exploring blind alleys, it is really I who am blind. For, they
will say, if that which we wish to characterize intrinsically is
an <I>experience</I>, then there <I>can</I> be no puzzle about
knowing <I>what kind</I> of experience it is, though there may be
a problem about how this knowledge is to be communicated to
others. And, indeed, it is tempting to suppose that if we
<I>should</I> happen, at a certain stage of our intellectual
development, to be able to classify an experience <I>only</I> as
<I>of the kind which</I> could be common to a <I>seeing</I>
and corresponding qualitative and existential <I>lookings</I>,
all we would have to do to acquire a 'direct designation' for
this kind of experience would be to pitch in, 'examine' it, locate
the kind which it exemplifies and which satisfies the above
description, name it -- say &quot;<font face="symbol">f</font>&quot; -- and, in full possession of
the concept of <font face="symbol">f</font>, classify such experiences, from now on,
as <font face="symbol">f</font> experiences.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At this point, it is clear, the concept -- or, as I have put it,
the myth -- of the given is being invoked to explain the
possibility of a direct account of immediate experience. The myth
insists that what I have been treating as one problem really
subdivides into two, one of which is really no problem at all,
while the other may have no solution. These problems are,
respectively
<p>
<ol>
<li> How do we become aware of an immediate experience as of one
sort, and of a simultaneous immediate experience as of another
sort?
<br>
<li> How can I know that the labels I attach to the sorts to which
my immediate experiences belong, are attached by you to the same
sorts? May not the sort I call &quot;red&quot; be the sort you call
&quot;green&quot; -- and so on systematically throughout the spectrum?
</ol>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We shall find that the second question, to be a philosophical
perplexity, presupposes a certain answer to the first
question -- indeed the answer given by the myth. And it is to this
first question that I now turn. Actually there are various forms
taken by the myth of the given in this connection, depending on
other philosophical commitments. But they all have in common the
idea that the awareness of certain <I>sorts</I> -- and by &quot;sorts&quot; I
have
in mind, in the first instance, determinate sense repeatables -- is
a primordial, non-problematic feature of 'immediate experience.'
In the context of conceptualism, as we have seen, this idea took
the form of treating sensations as though they were absolutely
specific, and infinitely complicated, <I>thoughts</I>. And it is
essential to an understanding of the empiricist tradition to
realize that whereas the contemporary problem of universals
primarily concerns the status of repeatable <I>determinate</I>
features of particular situations, and the contemporary problem
of abstract ideas is at least as much the problem of what it is
to be aware of determinate repeatables as of what it is to be
aware of determinable repeatables, Locke, Berkeley and, for that
matter, Hume saw the problem of abstract ideas as the problem of
what it is to be aware of <I>determinable</I> repeatables.<A
HREF="epm-n.html#10" target="n">{10}</A> Thus, an examination of
Locke's <I>Essay</I> makes it clear that he is thinking
of a sensation of white as the sort of thing that can become an
abstract idea (occurrent) of White -- a thought of White &quot;in the
Understanding&quot; -- merely by virtue of being separated from the
context of other sensations (and images) which accompany it on a
particular occasion. In other words, for Locke an abstract
(occurrent) idea of the determinate repeatable Whiteness is
nothing more than an isolated <I>image of white</I>, which, in
turn, differs from a <I>sensation of white</I> only (to use a
modern turn of phrase) by being &quot;centrally aroused.&quot;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In short, for Locke, the problem of how we come to be aware of
<I>determinate</I> sense repeatables is no problem at all. Merely
by virtue of having sensations and images we have this awareness.
<I>His</I> problem of abstract ideas is the problem of how we
come to be able to think of generic properties. And, as is clear
from the <I>Essay</I>, he approaches <I>this</I> problem in terms
of what might be called an &quot;adjunctive theory of specification,&quot;
that is, the view that (if we represent the idea of a
determinable as <I>the idea of being A</I>) the idea of a
determinate form of A can be represented as <I>the idea of being
A and B</I>. It is, of course, notorious that this won't account
for the relation of <I>the idea of being red</I> to <I>the idea
of being crimson</I>. By thinking of <I>conjunction</I> as the
fundamental logical relation involved in building up complex
ideas from simple ones, and as the principle of the difference
between determinable and determinate ideas, Locke precluded
himself from giving even a plausible account of the relation
between ideas of determinables and ideas of determinates. It is
interesting to speculate what turn his thought might have taken
had he admitted <I>disjunctive</I> as well as <I>conjunctive</I>
complex ideas, <I>the idea of being A or B</I> alongside <I>the
idea of being A and B</I>.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
27. But my purpose here is not to develop a commentary on the
shortcomings of Locke's treatment of abstract ideas, but to
emphasize that something which is a problem for us was not a
problem for him. And it is therefore important to note that the
same is true of Berkeley. His problem was not, as it is often
construed, &quot;How do we go from the awareness of <I>particulars</I>
to ideas of <I>repeatables</I>?&quot; but rather &quot;Granted that in
immediate experience we are aware of absolutely <I>specific</I>
sense qualities, how do we come to be conscious of genera
pertaining to them, and in what does this consciousness consist?&quot;
(This is not the only dimension of &quot;abstraction&quot; that concerned
him, but it is the one that is central to our purpose.) And,
contrary to the usual interpretation, the essential difference
between his account and Locke's consists in the fact that whereas
Locke was on the whole<A HREF="epm-n.html#11" target="n">{11}</A>
committed to the view that there can be an idea which is
<I>of</I> the genus without being <I>of</I> any of its species,
Berkeley insists that we can have an idea <I>of</I> a genus only
by having an idea <I>of</I> the genus <I>as</I>, to borrow a
useful Scotist term, <I>'contracted' into one of its
species</I>.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Roughly, Berkeley's contention is that if <I>being A</I> entails
<I>being B</I>, then there can be no such thing as an idea which
is <I>of A</I> without being <I>of B</I>. He infers that since
<I>being triangular</I> entails <I>having some determinately
triangular shape</I>, there cannot be an idea which is <I>of
triangle</I> without being <I>of some determinately triangular
shape</I>. We can be aware of generic triangularity only by
having an idea which is of triangularity as 'contracted' into one
of the specific forms of triangularity. Any of the latter will
do; they are all &quot;of the same sort.&quot;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
28. Now, a careful study of the <i>Treatise</i> makes it clear that Hume
is in the same boat as Berkeley and Locke, sharing with them the
presupposition that we have an unacquired ability to be aware of
determinate repeatables. It is often said that whereas he begins
the <I>Treatise</I> by characterizing 'ideas' in terms which do
not distinguish between <I>images</I> and <I>thoughts</I>, he
corrects this deficiency in Book I, Part I, Section vii. What
these students of Hume tend to overlook is that what Hume does in
this later section is give an account <I>not</I> of what it is to
think of <I>repeatables</I> whether determinable or determinate,
but of what it is to think of <I>determinables</I>, thus of color
as contrasted with particular shades of color. And his account of
the consciousness of determinables takes for granted that we have
a primordial ability to take account of <I>determinate</I>
repeatables. Thus, his later account is simply built on, and in
no sense a revision of, the account of ideas with which he opens
the <I>Treatise</I>.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How, then, does he differ from Berkeley and Locke? The latter two
had supposed that there must be such a thing as an
<I>occurrent</I> thought of a determinable, however much they
differed in their account of such thoughts. Hume, on the other
hand, assuming that there are occurrent thoughts of
<I>determinate</I> repeatables, <I>denies</I> that there are
occurrent thoughts of <I>determinables</I>. I shall spare the
reader the familiar details of Hume's attempt to give a
constructive account of our consciousness of determinables, nor
shall I criticize it. For my point is that however much Locke,
Berkeley, and Hume differ on the problem of abstract ideas, they
all take for granted that the human mind has an innate ability to
be aware of certain determinate sorts -- <I>indeed, that we are
aware of them simply by virtue of having sensations and
images</I>.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
29. Now, it takes but a small twist of Hume's position to get a
radically different view. For suppose that instead of
characterizing the initial elements of experience as impressions
of, e.g. <I>red</I>, Hume had characterized them as <I>red
particulars</I> (and I would be the last to deny that not only
Hume, but perhaps Berkeley and Locke as well, often treat
impressions or ideas <I>of red</I> as though they were <I>red
particulars</I>) then Hume's view, expanded to take into account
determinates as well as determinables, would become the view that
all consciousness of sorts or repeatables rests on an association
of <I>words</I> (e.g. &quot;red&quot;) with classes of resembling
particulars.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It clearly makes all the difference in the world how this
association is conceived. For if the formation of the association
involves not only the occurrence of resembling particulars, but
also the occurrence of the awareness <I>that they are resembling
particulars</I>, then the givenness of determinate kinds or
repeatables, say crimson, is merely being replaced by the
givenness of <I>facts</I> of the form <I>x resembles y</I>, and
we are back with an unacquired ability to be aware of
repeatables, in this case the repeatable <I>resemblance</I>. Even
more obviously, if the formation of the association involves not
only the occurrence of red particulars, but the awareness <I>that
they are red</I>, then the conceptualistic form of the myth has
merely been replaced by a realistic version, as in the classical
sense-datum theory.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If, however, the association is not mediated by the awareness of
facts either of the form <I>x resembles y</I>, or of the form <i>x
is <font face="symbol">f</font></i>, then we have a view of the general type which I will
call <I>psychological nominalism</I>, according to which
<I>all</I> awareness of <I>sorts, resemblances, facts</I>, etc.,
in short, all awareness of abstract entities -- indeed, all
awareness even of particulars -- is a linguistic affair. According
to it, not even the awareness of such sorts, resemblances, and
facts as pertain to so-called immediate experience is presupposed
by the process of acquiring the use of a language.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two remarks are immediately relevant:<br> 
(1) Although the form of psychological nominalism which one gets by modifying Hume's view
along the above lines has the essential merit that it avoids the
mistake of supposing that there are pure episodes of being aware
of sensory repeatables or sensory facts, and is committed to the
view that any event which can be referred to in these terms must
be, to use Ryle's expression, a mongrel categorical-hypothetical,
in particular, a verbal episode <I>as being the manifestation of
associative connections of the word-object and word-word
types</I>, it nevertheless is impossibly crude and inadequate as
an account of the simplest concept. <br>
(2) Once sensations and images have been purged of epistemic aboutness, the primary
reason for supposing that the fundamental associative tie between
language and the world must be between words and 'immediate
experiences' has disappeared, and the way is clear to recognizing
that basic word-world associations hold, for example, between
&quot;red&quot; and red <I>physical objects</I>, rather than between &quot;red&quot;
and a supposed class of private red particulars.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The second remark, it should be emphasized, does not imply that
private sensations or impressions may not be essential to the
formation of these associative connections. For one can certainly
admit that the tie between &quot;red&quot; and red physical objects -- which
tie makes it possible for &quot;red&quot; to mean the quality red -- is
<I>causally</I> mediated by sensations of red without being
committed to the mistaken idea that it is &quot;really&quot; sensations of
red, rather than red physical objects, which are the primary denotation of the word &quot;red.&quot;
