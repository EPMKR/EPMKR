<a name="sec39"></a>39. There are many strange and exotic specimens in the gardens of
philosophy: Epistemology, Ontology, Cosmology, to name but a few.
And clearly there is much good sense -- not only rhyme but reason -- 
to these labels. It is not my purpose, however, to animadvert on
the botanizing of philosophies and things philosophical, other
than to call attention to a recent addition to the list of
philosophical flora and fauna, the Philosophy of Science. Nor
shall I attempt to locate this new specialty in a classificatory
system. The point I wish to make, however, can be introduced by
calling to mind the fact that classificatory schemes, however
theoretical their purpose, have practical consequences: nominal
causes, so to speak, have real effects. As long as there was no
such subject as 'philosophy of science,' all students of
philosophy felt obligated to keep at least one eye part of the
time on both the methodological and the substantive aspects of
the scientific enterprise. And if the result was often a
confusion of the task of philosophy with the task of science, and
almost equally often a projection of the framework of the latest
scientific speculations into the common-sense picture of the
world (witness the almost unquestioned assumption, today, that
the common-sense world of physical objects in Space and Time must
be <I>analyzable</I> into spatially and temporally, or even
spatiotemporally, related <I>events</I>), at least it had the
merit of ensuring that reflection on the nature and implications
of scientific discourse was an integral and vital part of
philosophical thinking generally. But now that philosophy of
science has nominal as well as real existence, there has arisen 
the temptation to leave it to the specialists, and to confuse the
sound idea that philosophy is not science with the mistaken idea
that philosophy is independent of science.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
40. As long as discourse was viewed as a map, subdivided into a
side-by-side of sub-maps, each representing a sub-region in a
side-by-side of regions making up the total subject matter of
discourse, and as long as the task of the philosopher was
conceived to be the piecemeal one of analysis in the sense of
<I>definition</I> -- the task, so to speak, of &quot;making little ones
out of big ones&quot; -- one could view with equanimity the existence of
philosophical specialists -- specialists in formal and mathematical
logic, in perception, in moral philosophy, etc. For if discourse 
were as represented above, where would be the harm of each man
fencing himself off in his own garden? In spite, however, of the
persistence of the slogan &quot;philosophy is analysis,&quot; we now
realize that the atomistic conception of philosophy is a snare
and a delusion. For &quot;analysis&quot; no longer connotes the definition
of terms, but rather the clarification of the logical
structure -- in the broadest sense -- of discourse, and discourse no 
longer appears as one plane parallel to another, but as a tangle
of intersecting dimensions whose relations with one another and
with extra-linguistic fact conform to no single or simple
pattern. No longer can the philosopher interested in perception
say &quot;let him who is interested in prescriptive discourse analyze
its concepts and leave me in peace.&quot; Most if not all
philosophically interesting concepts are caught up in more than
one dimension of discourse, and while the atomism of early
analysis has a healthy successor in the contemporary stress on
journeyman tactics, the grand strategy of the philosophical
enterprise is once again directed toward that articulated and
integrated vision of man-in-the-universe -- or, shall I say
discourse-about-man-in-all-discourse -- which has traditionally
been its goal.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the moral I wish specifically to draw is that no longer can
one smugly say &quot;Let the person who is interested in scientific
discourse analyze scientific discourse and let the person who is
interested in ordinary discourse analyze ordinary discourse.&quot; Let
me not be misunderstood. I am not saying that in order to discern
the logic -- the polydimensional logic -- of ordinary discourse, it
is necessary to make use of the results or the methods of the
sciences. Nor even that, within limits, such a division of labor
is not a sound corollary of the journeyman's approach. My point
is rather that what we call the scientific enterprise is the
flowering of a dimension of discourse which already exists in
what historians call the &quot;prescientific stage,&quot; and that failure
to understand this type of discourse &quot;writ large&quot; -- in
science -- may lead, indeed has often led to a failure to
appreciate its role in &quot;ordinary usage,&quot; and, as a result, to a
failure to understand the full logic of even the most
fundamental, the &quot;simplest&quot; empirical terms.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec41"></a>41. Another point of equal importance. The procedures of
philosophical analysis as such may make no use of the methods or
results of the sciences. But familiarity with the trend of
scientific thought is essential to the <I>appraisal</I> of the
framework
categories of the common-sense picture of the world. For if the
line of thought embodied in the preceding paragraphs is sound,
if, that is to say, scientific discourse is but a continuation of
a dimension of discourse which has been present in human
discourse from the very beginning, then one would expect there to
be a sense in which the scientific picture of the world
<I>replaces</I>
the common-sense picture; a sense in which the scientific account
of &quot;what there is&quot; <I>supersedes</I> the descriptive ontology of
everyday life.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here one must be cautious. For there is a right way and a wrong
way to make this point. Many years ago it used to be confidently
said that science has shown, for example, that physical objects
aren't really colored. Later it was pointed out that if this is
interpreted as the claim that the sentence &quot;Physical objects have
colors&quot; expresses an empirical proposition which, though widely
believed by common sense, has been shown by science to be false,
then, of course, this claim is absurd. The idea that physical
objects aren't colored can make sense only as the (misleading)
expression of one aspect of a philosophical critique of the very
framework of physical objects located in Space and enduring
through Time. In short, &quot;Physical objects aren't really colored&quot;
makes sense only as a clumsy expression of the idea that there
are no such things as the colored physical objects of the
common-sense world, where this is interpreted, not as an
empirical proposition -- like &quot;There are no nonhuman featherless
bipeds&quot; -- <I>within</I> the common-sense frame, but as the
expression of
a rejection (in <I>some</I> sense) of this very framework itself,
in
favor of another built around different, if not unrelated,
categories. This rejection need not, of course, be a
<I>practical</I>
rejection. It need not, that is, carry with it a proposal to
brain-wash existing populations and train them to speak
differently. And, of course, as long as the existing framework is
used, it will be <I>incorrect</I> to say -- otherwise than to make
a
philosophical point <I>about the framework</I> -- that no object is
really
colored, or is located in Space, or endures through Time. But,
<I>speaking as a philosopher</I>, I am quite prepared to say that
the
common-sense world of physical objects in Space and Time is
unreal -- that is, that there are no such things. Or, to put it
less paradoxically, that in the dimension of describing and
explaining the world, science is the measure of all things, of
what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
43. There is a widespread impression that reflection on how we
learn the language in which, in everyday life, we describe the
world, leads to the conclusion that the categories of the
common-sense picture of the world have, so to speak, an
unchallengeable authenticity. There are, of course, different
conceptions of just what this fundamental categorial framework
is. For some it is sense contents and phenomenal relations
between them; for others physical objects, persons, and processes
in Space and Time. But whatever their points of difference, the
philosophers I have in mind are united in the conviction that
what is called the &quot;ostensive tie&quot; between our fundamental
descriptive vocabulary and the world rules out of court as
utterly absurd any notion that there are no such thing as this
framework talks about.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An integral part of this conviction is what I shall call (in an
extended sense) the <I>positivistic conception of science</I>,
the idea that the framework of theoretical objects (molecules,
electromagnetic fields, etc.) and their relationships is, so to
speak, an <I>auxiliary</I> framework. In its most explicit form,
it is the idea that theoretical objects and propositions
concerning them are &quot;calculational devices,&quot; the value and status
of which consist in their systematizing and heuristic role with
respect to confirmable generalizations formulated in the
framework of terms which enjoy a direct ostensive link with the
world. One is tempted to put this by saying that according to
these philosophers, the objects of ostensively linked discourse
behave <I>as if</I> and <I>only as if</I> they were bound up with
or consisted of scientific entities. But, of course, these
philosophers would hasten to point out (and rightly so) that
<p>
<center>X behaves as if it consisted of Y's</center>
<p>
makes sense only by contrast with
<p>
<center>X behaves as it does because it <I>does</I> consist of Y's</center>
<p>
whereas their contention is exactly that where the Y's are
<I>scientific</I> objects, no such contrast makes sense.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The point I am making is that as long as one thinks that there is
a framework, whether of physical objects or of sense contents,
the absolute authenticity of which is guaranteed by the fact that
the learning of this framework involves an &quot;ostensive step,&quot; so
long one will be tempted to think of the authority of theoretical
discourse as entirely derivative, that of a calculational
auxiliary, an effective heuristic device. It is one of my prime
purposes, in the following sections, to convince the reader that
this interpretation of the status of the scientific picture of
the world rests on two mistakes: (1) a misunderstanding (which I
have already exposed) of the ostensive element in the learning
and use of a language -- the Myth of the Given; (2) a reification
of the <I>methodological</I> distinction between theoretical and
non-theoretical discourse into a <I>substantive</I> distinction
between theoretical and non-theoretical existence.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
44. One way of summing up what I have been saying above is by
saying that there is a widespread impression abroad, aided and
abetted by a naive interpretation of concept formation, that
philosophers of science deal with a mode of discourse which is,
so to speak, a peninsular offshoot from the mainland of ordinary
discourse. The study of scientific discourse is conceived to be a
worthy employment for those who have the background and
motivation to keep track of it, but an employment which is
fundamentally a hobby divorced from the perplexities of the
mainland. But, of course, this summing up won't quite do. For all
philosophers would agree that no philosophy would be complete
unless it resolved the perplexities which arise when one attempts
to think through the relationship of the framework of modern
science to ordinary discourse. My point, however, is not that any
one would reject the idea that this is a proper task for
philosophy, but that, by approaching the language in which the
plain man describes and explains empirical fact with the
presuppositions of <I>givenness</I>, they are led to a
&quot;resolution&quot; of these perplexities along the lines of what I have
called the positivistic or peninsular conception of scientific
discourse -- a &quot;resolution&quot; which, I believe, is not only
superficial, but positively mistaken.
