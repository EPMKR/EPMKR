Somewhat over a quarter of a century ago, Professor Stephen
Pepper published a paper on <a href="https://www.ditext.com/pepper/emerge.html">&quot;Emergence&quot;</a><A HREF="ce.html#1">{1}</A><A
NAME="1b"></A> which was (and still is) symptomatic of a certain
way of thinking on this topic. The paper had the virtues of
brevity and clarity, and, which is more important, it went to the
heart of the matter. The fact that the crucial step in its
argument is a simple <i>non sequitur</i> by no means detracts
from its diagnostic value as a document in the controversy over
emergence.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Before we examine Professor Pepper's argument, two introductory
remarks are in order.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

1. Our aim is not to defend an emergentist picture of the world,
but rather to criticize an argument which, if successful, would
make this picture indefensible. As we see it, the question
whether the world is to be conceived along emergentist lines is a
scientific question which cannot be settled on a priori
grounds.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

2. The question &quot;Does the world contain emergents?&quot; requires to
be answered in terms of a scientific account of observable
phenomena, and although with reference to a given scientific
picture of the world the question is a <i>logical</i> one which
concerns the formal structure of this picture, taken absolutely,
the question shares the inductive character, and hence
corrigibility in principle, of the scientific enterprise. Indeed
since science presents us today not with one integrated
interpretation of the totality of observable phenomena, but
rather with a large number of partially integrated theories of
more limited scope, the question inevitably takes on a
<i>speculative</i> character, and becomes an attempt to
anticipate the logical structure of a theoretical 
framework which is still in gestation. This speculative dimension
must, of course, be distinguished from the previously noted
corrigibility (in principle) of <i>any</i> answer to the question
&quot;Are there emergents?&quot;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Professor Pepper writes,
<p>
<font size=-1>
Emergence signifies a kind of change. There seem to be three
important kinds of change considered possible in modern
metaphysical discussion. First, there is chance occurrence, the
assertion of a cosmic irregularity, an occurrence about which no
law could be stated. Second, there is what we may call a &quot;shift,&quot;
a change in which one characteristic replaces another, the sort
of change traditionally described as invariable succession and
when more refined described as a functional relation. Thirdly,
there is emergence, which is a cumulative change, a change in
which certain characteristics supervene upon other
characteristics, these characteristics being adequate to explain
the occurrence on their level. The important points here are
first, that in discussing emergence we are not discussing the
possibility of cosmic chance. The emergent evolutionists admit a
thoroughgoing regularity in nature. And secondly, we are not
discussing the legitimacy of shifts. These also are admitted. The
issue is whether in addition to shifts there are emergent
changes.<p>

The theory of emergence involves three propositions: (1) that
there are levels of existence defined in terms of degrees of
integration; (2) that there are marks which distinguish these
levels from one another over and above the degrees of
integration; (3) that it is impossible to deduce the marks of a
higher level from those of a lower level, and perhaps also
(though this is not clear) impossible to deduce marks of a lower
level from those of a higher. The first proposition, that there
are degrees of integration in nature, is not controversial. The
specific issue arises from the second and third propositions. The
second states that there is cumulative change, the third that
such change is not predictable.<p>

What I wish to show is that each of these propositions is subject
to a dilemma: (1) either the alleged emergent change is not
cumulative or it is epiphenomenal; (2) either the alleged
emergent change is predictable like any physical change, or it is
epiphenomenal. I assume that a theory of wholesale
epiphenomenalism is metaphysically unsatisfactory. I feel the
more justified in making this assumption because I have been led
to understand that the theory of emergent evolution has been
largely developed as a corrective of mechanistic theories with
their attendant psycho-physical dualisms and epiphenomenalisms.
(p. 241)</font><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The distinctions drawn in the first of these paragraphs provides
the basic framework of Pepper's argument. Pointing out, quite
correctly, that indeterminism is neither essential to, nor
characteristic of, theories of emergent evolution, Pepper draws a
distinction between two possible types of regularity: (a)
&quot;shifts&quot; -- that is to say regularities of the kind &quot;traditionally
described as invariable succession&quot;; (b) regularities &quot;in which
certain characteristics supervene upon other characteristics.&quot;
Notice, however, that to his description of the second kind of
regularity he adds the phrase &quot;these [latter] characteristics
being adequate to explain the occurrences on their level.&quot; By
adding this phrase, Pepper implies that there could be no such
thing as a regularity in which certain characteristics supervene
upon other characteristics but in which the lower level
characteristics were not adequate to explain the occurrences on
their level. In other words, he implies that &quot;supervening&quot; or
emergent characteristics are, merely by virtue of being such,
unnecessary to the explanation of occurrences at the lower
level -- that is to say, of occurrences insofar as they exemplify
nonemergent characteristics. And, indeed, he implies that this is
such a well-known and generally accepted fact that its use
requires no justification in this day and age. We are not
surprised, then, to find him claiming, without further ado, in
the fifth paragraph, that &quot;a theory of emergent qualities is
palpably a theory of epiphenomena&quot; (p. 242).<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now the claim that emergent qualities are (&quot;palpably&quot;)
epiphenomenal can scarcely be just the claim that emergent
qualities have necessary-and-sufficient conditions.
&quot;Epiphenomenal&quot; carries, and is intended by Pepper to carry, the
connotation &quot;making no difference.&quot; Obviously &quot;having a
necessary-and sufficient condition&quot; is not identical in sense
with &quot;making no difference.&quot; Yet the idea that emergent qualities
must be epiphenomenal is clearly tied up with the idea that a
certain context specified in terms of lower level characteristics
is the necessary-and-sufficient condition for the appearance of
the emergent quality. A glance at the conventional diagram will
show what is going on.<p>
(A)
<center><table border=0>
<tr><td align=center>H</tr>             
<tr><td align=center>^</tr>   
<tr><td align=center>|</tr>   
<tr><td align=center><font face="symbol">F</font><sub>0</sub> =====> <font face="symbol">F</font><sub>1</sub> =====> <font face="symbol">F</font><sub>2</sub><p></tr>
</table></center>


This diagram is designed to be a representation of the following
propositions: (1) <font face="symbol">F</font><sub>0</sub> is a sufficient condition of <font face="symbol">F</font><sub>1</sub>; (2)
<font face="symbol">F</font><sub>1</sub> is a sufficient condition of <font face="symbol">F</font><sub>2</sub>; (3) <font face="symbol">F</font><sub>1</sub> is also
the necessary and sufficient condition of H. But while this is
all that the diagram is <i>intended</i> to represent, strongly
suggests
that H is, in the proper sense of the term, an epiphenomenon.
That this suggestion is unwarranted, that the information summed
up in the diagram leaves open the question as to whether H is an
epiphenomenon, will be established at a later stage in our
argument. For the moment we shall limit ourselves to some
reflection on the phrase &quot;making no difference.&quot;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is obvious that if H is to &quot;make a difference&quot; there must be a
difference between situations in which it is present and
situations in which it is not. That there is one such difference
is clear; H-situations differ from non-H-situations in that the
former are also <font face="symbol">F</font><sub>1</sub> situations and the latter not. But this
difference, far from being a difference that would keep H from
being epiphenomenal, is at least part of what is meant by calling
H an epiphenomenon. And, indeed, if there were no other
difference between H-situations and non-H-situations, H would be
epiphenomenal. But what other difference could there be? Clearly
it is a mistake to look for this new difference in the form of
another characteristic that is present when H is present and
absent when H is absent. There remains only the possibility that
H-situations are governed by different laws than
non-H-situations. And this not in the trivial sense that
H-situations conform to the law &quot;H if and only if <font face="symbol">F</font><sub>1</sub>&quot; whereas
non-H-situations do not (save vacuously), but in the important
sense that the lower level characteristics themselves exhibit a
different lawfulness in H-situations. In other words, for
emergent qualities to make a difference which removes them from
the category of the epiphenomenal, in any significant sense of
this term, there must be &quot;emergent laws.&quot; We hasten to add that
the last few remarks are informal in character, and are intended
to be hints and signposts of what is coming, rather than
definitive clarifications.
<p>

<CENTER><H2>II</H2></CENTER>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pepper's &quot;first dilemma,&quot; designed to prove that &quot;either the
alleged emergent change is not cumulative or it is epiphenomenal&quot;
begins with a distinction between those theories of emergence
according to which what emerges are <i>qualities</i> and those
according to which what emerges are <i>laws</i>. He points out
that in Alexander's system it is new qualities which emerge; but
he expresses the conviction that &quot;most emergent evolutionists
have theories of emergent laws&quot; (p. 242). As we have already
noted, he claims that &quot;a theory of emergent qualities is palpably
a theory of epiphenomena.&quot; On the other hand &quot;it is not so
obvious that a theory of emergent laws must also be such -- or else
cease to be a theory of emergence&quot; (p. 242). But though he finds
the latter claim &quot;not so obvious,&quot; it is, as he sees it, equally
true, and it is to the task of showing it to be true that he now
turns.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Before we take up his argument, some remarks on his
classification of theories of emergence are in order. Once again
we find fewer alternatives presented than are abstractly
possible. Postponing (with Pepper) the question as to what could
be meant by &quot;emergent law,&quot; the dichotomy &quot;emergent
quality&quot; -- &quot;emergent law&quot; yields a trichotomy of emergent
theories: (a) theories of emergent qualities without emergent
laws; (b) theories of emergent qualities with emergent laws; (c)
theories of emergent laws without emergent qualities. Now we have
already suggested that of these three only the first is
&quot;palpably&quot; committed to epiphenomenalism (unless, that is, a
theory of emergent qualities is &quot;epiphenomenalistic&quot; merely by
virtue of the fact that it recognizes that emergent qualities
have necessary-and-sufficient conditions). We now notice that to
make this first alternative consistent with determinism (which is
not in question in this paper) we must either refuse to call the
regularities between emergent qualities and the contexts in which
they emerge &quot;laws,&quot; or, calling them &quot;laws,&quot; we must deny that
they are &quot;emergent.&quot; Pepper, in effect, by drawing his
distinction between &quot;shifts&quot; and &quot;superveniencies&quot; takes the
former alternative. In these terms, the regularities in diagram
(A) between <font face="symbol">F</font><sub>0</sub> and <font face="symbol">F</font><sub>1</sub>, and between <font face="symbol">F</font><sub>1</sub> and <font face="symbol">F</font><sub>2</sub> would be
shifts, whereas that between <font face="symbol">F</font><sub>1</sub> and H would be a
regularity of supervenience. And in these terms, the three
alternatives above become (a') theories of emergent qualities
without emergent shifts; (b') theories of emergent qualities with
emergent shifts; (c') theories of emergent shifts without
emergent qualities. But from the standpoint of one whose concern
is with the question &quot;Does emergence involve epiphenomenalism?&quot;
and who is convinced that emergent qualities must as such be
epiphenomenal, this trichotomy reduces to this dichotomy:
theories without emergent shifts -- theories with emergent shifts.
And from this standpoint, and in these terms, the issue would be
&quot;Do emergent shifts involve epiphenomenalism?&quot;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But this is not how Pepper sets up his problem. In his first
formulation, as we have seen, he makes use of the general notion
of law, and sees his purpose as that of showing that &quot;a theory of
emergent laws . . . must be [a theory of epiphenomena] or else
cease to be a theory of emergence.&quot; Then, after drawing a
distinction between laws and the regularities they describe, he
reformulates his task as that of showing that &quot;all natural
regularities are shifts.&quot; At first sight this is puzzling indeed,
for as the term &quot;shift&quot; was introduced, it amounts to the task of
showing that no natural regularities are regularities in which
&quot;certain characteristics supervene upon other characteristics.&quot;
And since the understood context is &quot;under pain of
epiphenomenalism,&quot; this amounts, in turn. to the task of showing
that supervening characteristics must be epiphenomena. But at
first sight this is only verbally different from the task of
showing that emergent qualities are epiphenomena -- and this, for
Pepper, is no task, since the <i>demonstrandum</i> is &quot;palpably&quot;
true.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now the key to the resolution of this difficulty is the
philosophical virtuosity of the term &quot;characteristic.&quot; Often used
in the sense of property, frequently used to cover both
<i>properties</i> and <i>relations</i>, it is here being used in
so broad a sense that even <i>regularities</i> become
characteristics. Pepper,
indeed, is thinking of an emergent law as a <i>supervening
regularity</i> -- as, so to speak, a regularity which rides
piggy-back on a lower level regularity. It is little wonder that,
approaching it with this mental set, he finds the notion of an
emergent law absurd. As he sees it, the emergentist who speaks of
emergent laws is able to swallow this absurdity because he
mistakes a &quot;whole hierarchy of different laws&quot; -- each of which,
according to Pepper, describes &quot;the same natural
regularities&quot; -- for a &quot;ladder of cosmic regularities.&quot; Pepper does
not develop this point. However, in terms of contemporary
controversy, the initial mistake of the emergentist, according to
Pepper, is to be so fascinated by the difference between one
framework of concepts and laws (e.g., biology) and the proximate
lower level framework of concepts and laws (e.g., organic
chemistry) that he finds it difficult to believe that the one
could be reducible to the other. What is not clear is whether
Pepper believes that the denial (in principle) of reducibility
involves the absurdities he finds in the notion of emergent
laws.<p>

<CENTER><H2>III</H2></CENTER>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Be this as it may, the fact remains that Pepper does find the
emergentist view absurd, and offers an argument to prove it. He
seeks, as we have seen, to show that &quot;all natural regularities
are shifts.&quot; Now this thesis is equivalent to &quot;there are no
emergent (supervening) regularities&quot; only if &quot;shifts&quot; is being
used in such a way that it connotes absence of supervenience.
Given this connotation, Pepper's formulation of his task is
equivalent to our formulation at the end of the preceding
section, namely, &quot;Do emergent shifts involve epiphenomenalism?&quot; 
Indeed, in the terminology of that section, it becomes &quot;Is the
notion of an emergent shift absurd?&quot; Here is his argument:<p>

<font size=-1>
Let us suppose a shift at level B is described as a function of
four variables <i>q, r, s</i>, and <i>t</i>. Let us then suppose
that <i>r</i> and <i>s</i> constitute an integration giving rise
to level C at which level a new cosmic regularity emerges that
can be described as a function of four variables <i>r, s, a</i>,
and <i>b</i>. <i>r</i> and <i>s</i> must necessarily be
variables in this emergent law even though they are variables of
level B, because they constitute part of the conditions under
which the emergent law is possible. Theoretically, to be sure,
the emergent law may be thought of either as a function of new
variables or as a new function of C-level variables. But actually
only the former is possible. For if the new law were not
<i>f<sub>1</sub> (q,r,s,t)</i>, but were <i>f<sub>2</sub> (q,r,s,t)</i>, then, of
course, it would never be <i>f<sub>1</sub> (q,r,s,t)</i>, unless the event
were a chance occurrence in which case no regularity could be
described anyway. The point is, either <i>f<sub>1</sub></i>, adequately
describes the interrelationships of <i>(q,r,s,t)</i> or
<i>f<sub>2</sub></i> does; or if neither adequately describes the
interrelationships there is some <i>f<sub>3</sub></i> that does, but there
cannot be two adequate descriptions of the same
interrelationships among the same variables.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

An emergent law must, therefore, involve the emergence of new
variables. But these new variables either have some functional
relationship with the rest of the lower level variables or they
haven't. If they haven't, they are sheer epiphenomena, and the
view resolves itself into a theory of qualitative emergence. If
they have, they have to be included among the total set of
variables described by the lower level functional relation; they
have to drop down and take their places among the lower level
variables as elements in a lower level shift.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Such being the case, our dilemma is established so far as
concerns cumulative change -- either there is no such thing or it
is epiphenomenal . . . (pp. 242-43)</font><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before embarking upon a more general discussion, we shall examine
the argument in Pepper's form. It can be restated as follows:<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1. If a function <i>f<sub>1</sub> (q,r,s,t)</i> &quot;adequately describes the
interrelationships&quot; among four variables <i>q, r, s</i> and
<i>t</i>, then no
other function <i>f<sub>2</sub></i>, nonequivalent to <i>f<sub>1</sub></i>, of these
variables can do so. &quot;There cannot be two adequate descriptions
of the same interrelationships among the same variables.&quot;<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2. If <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> &quot;adequately describes the interrelationships&quot;
among these variables after the 'integration' (and putative
emergence) then, since sheer difference of time has no material
consequence, <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> must also be the adequate description of
these interrelationships before the integration. Consequently f<sub>1</sub>
could only be the adequate description of these
interrelationships before the integration if it were equivalent
to <i>f<sub>2</sub></i>, which, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, it is not.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3. Hence, if <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> &quot;adequately describes the
interrelationships&quot;
after the integration, <i>f<sub>1</sub></i> cannot adequately describe the
relationships which obtain before the integration. &quot;The point is,
either f<sub>1</sub> adequately describes the interrelationships of
<i>(q,r,s,t)</i> or <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> does; or if neither adequately
describes the interrelationships, there is some <i>f<sub>3</sub></i> which
does . . .&quot;<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But surely this is too strong -- a veritable <i>ignoratio
elenchi</i>. What the emergentist says is that there is a region
in the fourspace <i>qrst</i> within which <i>f<sub>1</sub> (q,r,s,t)</i> =
0 holds. This region is the &quot;lower level of integration&quot; -- e.g.,
physicochemical professes which are not occurring in protoplasm.
On the other hand, there is another region -- the &quot;emergent&quot;
region -- in which <i>f<sub>2</sub> (q,r,s,t)</i> = 0 holds, <i>f<sub>1</sub> =/=
f<sub>2</sub></i>. And a claim of this kind is mathematically
unexceptionable, since it amounts to no more than the claim that
a function may graduate the empirical data in restricted regions
but break down when extrapolated. Such a &quot;breakdown&quot; does not
mean, however, that the fit attained in either the subregion
fitted by <i>f<sub>1</sub></i> or that fitted by <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> is a &quot;chance
occurrence.&quot; The fit may be excellent, and the demarcation of the
regions precise (or, if gradual, thoroughly lawful) so that the
&quot;chance occurrence&quot; interpretation is as definitely excludable as
it ever can be by inductive methods. It should be noted that
phenomena in describing which scientists speak of &quot;laws of
composition&quot; belong to this category.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But while the notion of different regions in the fourspace
<i>qrst</i> exhibiting different functional relationships is
mathematically unexceptionable, is it emergence? Here the first
thing to note is that the notion, as such, involves no
&quot;supervenience.&quot; For (a) no emergent variables have been
introduced; <i>f<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> being functions of the same
four variables; and (b) it is not being claimed that there are
'piggy-back' regularities. When a situation exhibits a
constellation of values of <i>q,r,s</i>, and <i>t</i> falling
within region<sub>1</sub> of the fourspace, it is not exhibiting a
constellation falling within region<sub>2</sub>, and vice versa. When a
situation conforms to <i>f<sub>2</sub></i>, it is not conforming to
<i>f<sub>1</sub></i>, and vice versa. Thus, to the extent that 'emergence'
connotes the simultaneous presence in a single situation of two
or more levels, the notion we have been analyzing is not, as
such, a matter of emergence. This, however, is not to say that
there is no philosophical use of &quot;emergence&quot; -- a use, that is, to
connote something of philosophical interest -- according to which
cases of this kind are cases of emergence. Thus, the mere fact
that the highly complex organic compounds which are found in
protoplasm made their appearance late in the history of the
universe would <i>not</i> be a fact of emergence in any
philosophically interesting sense. But if we add to this the
notion that protoplasm exhibits a constellation of
physicochemical variables which belongs in a region of the
n-space defined by those variables that conform to a different
function than do the regions to which belong constellations
exhibited by less complex physicochemical situations, then the
use of the term &quot;emergence&quot; seems not inappropriate. And, indeed,
many philosophers who have made use of the concept of <i>levels
of integration</i> or <i>levels of causality</i> seem to have had
something like the above in mind.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But it is reasonably clear that most emergentist philosophers
have had something more in mind. They have spoken of the
emergence of properties. And while there is a usage of &quot;property&quot;
(in the sense of <i>dispositional property</i>) in which to
mention a
property of an object is to mention a functional correlation
exhibited by that object -- so that to say, for example, that
protoplasm has an emergent property would be just another way of
saying what was said above in terms of different functions
holding for different regions in the n-space of physicochemical
variables -- not all the 'properties' that have been said to
'emerge' can be given this interpretation. Thus, the qualia of
feeling and sensation have been said to emerge. It must be
confessed, however, that emergentists have tended to lump into
one category of &quot;emergent properties&quot; items which require
radically different treatment, e.g., <i>sense qualities, life,
purpose, value, thought</i>.<p>

<CENTER><H2>IV</H2></CENTER>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are now in a position to make a more penetrating analysis of
Pepper's claim that theories of emergent qualities are committed
to epiphenomenalism. If determinism is assumed, so that these
qualities are themselves lawfully related to the lower level
variables, then it must be granted that descriptive laws
predicting the course of the latter can, in principle, always be
formulated in terms of them alone. For suppose the emergents to
be <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, depending for their appearance upon,
say, appropriate values of <i>q,r,s</i> and <i>t</i>, so that,
for example,

<blockquote>
<i>a = g(q,r)</i><br>
<i>b = h(s,t)</i>
</blockquote>

then the function which adequately describes the
interrelationships of the inclusive set of variables
(<i>q,r,s,t,a,b</i>), call it <i>E(q,r,s,t,a,b)</i>, can be
written without <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, for it can be written as
<i>E[q,r,s,t,g(q,r),h(s,t)]</i> or <i>f<sub>3</sub>(q,r,s,t)</i>.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now Pepper at this point develops an argument which can be
represented as follows:<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1. Unless <i>f<sub>3</sub>(q,r,s,t)</i> is equivalent to <i>f<sub>1</sub>(q,r,s,t)</i>, they cannot both hold (and, of course, Pepper is
quite right <i>if</i> both <i>f<sub>3</sub></i> and <i>f<sub>1</sub></i> are intended
to cover the entire fourspace determined by these variables).<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2. But for <i>f<sub>3</sub></i> to be equivalent to <i>f<sub>1</sub></i>, is for
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> to be
epiphenomenal. (Again Pepper is quite right on the same condition
we have pointed out in our comment on 1.)<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3. Thus, if <i>f<sub>3</sub></i> holds, and <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are not
epiphenomenal, then <i>f<sub>1</sub></i> cannot hold. In other words, if
<i>f<sub>3</sub></i> holds and <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are not
epiphenomenal, then <i>f<sub>3</sub></i> must hold both 'before' and
'after' the
appearance of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4. But <i>f<sub>3</sub>(q,r,s,t)</i> is just another way of writing
<i>E(q,r,s,t,a,b)</i>. Therefore, both 'before' and 'after'
integration the phenomena in
question are adequately described by the function
<i>E(q,r,s,t,a,b)</i>.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5. Thus, the supposed emergents <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> &quot;have to be
included among the total set of variables described by the lower
level functional relation; they have to drop down and take their
place among the lower level variables as elements in a lower
level shift&quot; (pp. 242-43).<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, once we drop, as we have seen we must, the assumption
that <i>f<sub>3</sub></i> and <i>f<sub>1</sub></i> are intended by the emergentist to
hold for the same regions in qrst-space (<i>f<sub>3</sub></i> presumably
holds for all regions, <i>f<sub>1</sub></i> only for the &quot;lower level of
integration&quot;), the argument falls
apart. For while the emergentist must indeed admit that if <i>f<sub>3</sub></i> and <i>f<sub>1</sub></i> are equivalent, then <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
make no difference, it is open to him to say that the difference
made by <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is just the fact that 
<i>f<sub>1</sub>(qrst)</i>, which holds in regions of <i>qrst</i>-space
which are
unaccompanied by <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, is not equivalent to the
function which
holds of these variables for regions in which they are
accompanied by <i>a</i> and/or <i>b</i>.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A survey of the literature makes it clear that 'sense quality,'
'sensa,' 'raw feels,' '(sensory) consciousness' -- the terms are
almost as numerous as the authors -- are among the more confidently
backed candidates for the role of emergent. And it may be helpful
to conclude our examination of emergence on the more concrete
note of a discussion of certain logical aspects of this
particular claim. In doing so, however, we shall avoid, as far as
possible, those labyrinthine issues concerning the sense, if any,
in which sense qualities, supposing them to be emergent, can
appropriately be said to be 'in' the brain. It should, however,
be pointed out that this problem concerns the structure of a
(future) <i>scientific</i> account of sensory consciousness, and
it must be carefully distinguished from the problem of analyzing
ordinary language to determine the relation of talk about seeing
colors, feeling pain, having an itch, etc., to talk about the
body and bodily behavior. Science has the task of <i>creating</i>
a way
of talking about the sensory activities of the central nervous
system, not that of analyzing antecedent ordinary language about
sense experience. After all, we were talking about seeing colors
and itching long before there was such a notion as that of the
C.N.S., and long before it was realized that the brain had
anything to do with these matters. Our present concern is with a
possible logical feature (namely emergence) of the coming
scientific account of what goes on &quot;in Jones&quot; when common sense
correctly says that Jones is seeing green or has a toothache,
etc.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, to suppose that &quot;raw feels&quot; as we shall call them, will be
found to be emergent -- though not epiphenomenal -- in this future
scientific account, is to suppose that raw feels (or, better, raw
feel dimensions) are the <i>a</i>'s and <i>b</i>'s in the
generalized function

<blockquote>
<i>E(q,r,s,t,a,b,) = f<sub>3</sub>(q,r,s,t)</i>
</blockquote>

where

<blockquote>
<i>a = g(q,r)<br>
b = h(s,t)</i>
</blockquote>

That is, raw feels depend upon the variables <i>q,r,s,t</i> which
also characterize pre-emergent situations. But raw reels do not
occur
in the presence of matter generally; only matter as it is in the
living brain. The function <i>f-1(q,r,s,t)</i> which fits the
behavior of matter everywhere else, breaks down when applied to
brains. This,
as we have seen, is the sense in which raw feels &quot;make a
difference.&quot;<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But how will the scientist be led to introduce raw feels into
picture of the world? Will he, indeed should he, not be content
with noting that one region of <i>qrst</i>-space conforms to
<i>f<sub>1</sub></i> whereas another region (roughly brains) conforms to
<i>f<sub>2</sub></i>? Or, to put it differently, constructing the function
<i>E[q,r,s,t,g(q,r),h(s,t)]</i> which combines these into one
function holding for the entire space, what would lead him, as
scientist, to speak of the part-functions <i>g</i> and <i>h</i>
as correlating values of the lower level variables <i>q,r,s</i>,
and <i>t</i> with values of raw-feel variables? Now one answer
would be that, after all, we experience raw feels, and it is the
business of science to fit them into its world picture. And even
in the present primitive state of psychophysiology we can confirm
certain crude functional dependencies both of the
(psychophysical) kind <i>g</i> and <i>h</i>, and of the
(physicopsychical kind <i>f<sub>3</sub>(q,r,s,t,g,h)</i>.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the controversy over Behaviorism has made us sensitive about
the scientific standing of 'sensations,' 'images,' and 'raw
feels' generally. Thus, it is often thought that the only concept
of 'seeing green' that belongs in a scientifically constructed
psychology is one that is defined in terms of molar behavior. And
it is obvious that at best such concepts would designate
<i>correlates</i> of raw feels, and not the latter themselves.
But how could we legitimately introduce raw feels or other
emergent qualities into the &quot;psychology of the other one?&quot; Here
we have to distinguish between &quot;descriptive&quot; and &quot;theoretical&quot;
aims. While it is true that prior to the examination of living
brains, the function <i>f<sub>1</sub></i> was quite adequate, and though
afterwards we saw that <i>f<sub>3</sub></i> was required for the case of
brains, this does not force us to introduce the new variables a
and b. For, as we have seen, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are eliminable
from the descriptive laws. Nevertheless, the introduction of
these new variables might be
'forced' upon us by theoretical necessities (insofar as we are
ever forced to make theoretical sense by the postulation of
hypothetical entities). For example, a brain consists of matter
of special kinds in certain arrangements. Complex hydrocarbon
molecules, potassium ions, free iron, and electromagnetic fields
exhibit certain &quot;exceptionless&quot; regularities (outside of brains)
which correspond to Pepper's <i>f<sub>1</sub></i>. Many arrangements turn
out to be such that we can deduce their properties, including the
ways in which the components will behave <i>in situ</i>, from the
<i>f<sub>1</sub></i> functions. But for living brains this turns out not to
be the
case. The flow of electrons at the synaptic interface &quot;breaks the
laws.&quot; But it is not lawless, since the more general function
<i>f<sub>3</sub></i> takes care of it. However, we were able to <i>derive
f<sub>1</sub></i> from other laws, those of the micro-theory, involving
only variables <i>q,r,s,t</i>. When we have succeeded in working
up a theory which will enable us to derive <i>f<sub>3</sub></i>, the
theoretical primitives include other terms than those which were
sufficient for an explanation of pre-emergent phenomena. These
other terms -- <i>a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub></i>, etc. -- are the items to which
the variables <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> pertain; and while we can
write <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> as functions (<i>g</i> and <i>h</i>)
of <i>q, r, s</i>, and <i>t</i>, it should not be supposed that
the <i>a</i>'s have thereby been shown to be analyzable into the
entities for which <i>q, r, s</i>, and <i>t</i> in turn suffice
as descriptive functors. If this seems odd, one should remember
that whenever a theory is &quot;correct&quot; it means that we have
succeeded (among other things) in formulating a lawful relation
between a value, <i>x</i>, appertaining to the theoretical entity
and a value, <i>y</i>, taken on by the observed. Hence, in the
present case we can write an equation explicitly relating these
<i>values</i>,

<blockquote>
<i>x = f(y)</i><p>
</blockquote>

But the fact that we can write this equation obviously does not
mean that the entity to which the value x appertains is being
equated with the situation to which the value y appertains, any
more than the discovery of a functional relation between a
person's height and weight would require us to suppose that
somehow a person's height is the same thing as his weight.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now an argument offered by Pepper in the closing section of his
paper hinges partly on a failure to make this last
distinction.

It is a natural ideal of science to derive all laws from a
certain limited number of primitive laws or principles -- not
necessarily from one single law -- and so to convert science into a
mathematics. If it could be assumed that there are no chance
occurrences such a system of laws should be obtainable, though it
might look very different from the traditional mechanics. The
assumption of science appears to be that such a system is
obtainable. I do not know what else the dissatisfaction of
science with inconsistencies could mean.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, there seems to be no intention on the part of emergent
evolutionists to deny that such a system is possible or to assert
that there are chance occurrences. If that is so, they seem to be
faced with the following dilemma: either the emergent laws they 
are arguing for are ineffectual and epiphenomenal, or they are
effectual and capable of being absorbed into the physical system.
But apparently they want their laws to be both effectual and at
the same time no part of the physical system . . . (pp.

First a terminological point. Among the various meanings of the
word <i>physical</i> let us distinguish the following for present
purposes:

<dl>
<dt><i>Physical<sub>1</sub></i>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an event or entity is
<i>physical<sub>1</sub></i> if it
belongs in the space-time network.

<dt><i>Physical<sub>2</sub></i>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an event or entity is
<i>physical<sub>2</sub></i> if it
is definable in terms of theoretical primitives adequate to
describe completely the actual states though not necessarily the
potentialities of the universe before the appearance of life.
</dl>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, an emergentist account (of the kind we have been
constructing) of raw feels denies that the latter are
<i>physical<sub>2</sub></i>. But this in no way involves the denial that
they are <i>physical<sub>1</sub></i>. And indeed this emergentist account
definitely gives them a <i>physical<sub>1</sub></i> status. And if the
equations

<blockquote>
<i>a = g(q,r)<br>
b = h(s,t)</i>
</blockquote>

permit the elimination of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> from the
descriptive function relating the <i>physical<sub>2</sub></i> variables
<i>q,r,s</i>, and <i>t</i>, this fact, as we
have just seen, by no means involves that the emergent entities
with which the variables <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are associated
must also be <i>physical<sub>2</sub></i>.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Whether or not there are any emergents in the sense we have
sought to clarify is an empirical question. Our only aim has been
to show that Pepper's &quot;formal&quot; demonstration of the impossibility
of non-epiphenomenal emergents is invalid.<p><hr>
