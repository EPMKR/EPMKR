<p>
30. There is a source of the Myth of the Given to which even
philosophers who are suspicious of the whole idea of <I>inner
episodes</I> can fall prey. This is the fact that when we picture
a child -- or a carrier of slabs -- learning his <I>first</I>
language, <I>we</I>, of course, locate the language learner in a
structured logical space in which <I>we</I> are at home. Thus, we
conceive of him as a person (or, at least, a potential person) in
a world of physical objects, colored, producing sounds, existing
in Space and Time. But though it is we who are familiar with this
logical space, we run the danger, if we are not careful, of
picturing the language learner as having <I>ab initio</I> some
degree of awareness -- &quot;pre-analytic,&quot; limited and fragmentary
though it may be -- of this same logical space. We picture his
state as though it were rather like our own when placed in a
strange forest on a dark night. In other words, unless we are
careful, we can easily take for granted that the process of
teaching a child to use a language is that of teaching it to
discriminate elements within a logical space of particulars,
universals, facts, etc., of which it is already
undiscriminatingly aware, and to associate these discriminated
elements with verbal symbols. And this mistake is in principle
the same whether the logical space of which the child is supposed
to have this  undiscriminating awareness is conceived by <i>us</i> to be
that of physical objects or of private sense contents.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The real test of a theory of language lies not in its account of
what has been called (by H. H. Price) &quot;thinking in absence,&quot; but
in its account of &quot;thinking in presence&quot; -- that is to say, its
account of those occasions on which the fundamental connection of
language with nonlinguistic fact is exhibited. And many theories
which look like psychological nominalism when one views their
account of thinking in absence, turn out to be quite
&quot;Augustinian&quot; when the scalpel is turned to their account of
thinking in presence.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec31"></a>31. Now, the friendly use I have been making of the phrase
&quot;psychological nominalism&quot; may suggest that I am about to
<I>equate</I> concepts with words, and thinking, in so far as it
is episodic, with verbal episodes. I must now hasten to say that
I shall do nothing of the sort, or, at least, that if I <I>do</I>
do <I>something</I> of the sort, the view I shall shortly be
developing is only in a relatively Pickwickian sense an equation
of thinking with the use of language. I wish to emphasize,
therefore, that as I am using the term, the primary connotation
of &quot;psychological nominalism&quot; is the denial that there is any
awareness of logical space prior to, or independent of, the
acquisition of a language.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, although I shall later be distinguishing between
<i>thoughts</i> and their verbal <I>expression</I>, there is a point of
fundamental importance which is best made before more subtle
distinctions are drawn. To begin with, it is perfectly clear that
the word &quot;red&quot; would not be a <I>predicate</I> if it didn't have
the logical syntax characteristic of predicates. Nor would it be
the predicate it is, unless, in certain frames of mind, at least,
we tended to respond to red objects in standard circumstances
with something having the force of &quot;This is red.&quot; And once we
have abandoned the idea that learning to use the word &quot;red&quot;
involves antecedent episodes of the <I>awareness of
redness</I> -- not to be confused, of course, with <I>sensations of
red</I> -- there is a temptation to suppose that the word &quot;red&quot;
means the quality <I>red</I> by virtue of these two facts:
briefly, the fact that it has the <I>syntax</I> of a predicate,
and the fact that it is a <I>response</I> (in certain
circumstances) to red objects.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But this account of the meaningfulness of &quot;red,&quot; which Price has
correctly stigmatized as the &quot;thermometer view,&quot; would have
little plausibility if it were not reinforced by another line of
thought which takes its point of departure from the superficial
resemblance of
<p>
<center>(In German) &quot;<I>rot</I>&quot; means <I>red</I></center>
<p>
to such relational statements as
<p>
<center>Cowley adjoins Oxford.</center>
<p>
For once one assimilates the form
<p>
<center>&quot;. . .&quot; means - - -</center>
<p>
to the form
<p>
<center>x R y</center>
<p>
and thus takes it for granted that meaning is a relation between
a word and a nonverbal entity, it is tempting to suppose that the
relation in question is that of association.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The truth of the matter, of course, is that statements of the
form &quot;'. . .' means - - -&quot; are <I>not</I> relational statements,
and that while it is indeed the case that the word &quot;rot&quot; could
not mean the quality <I>red</I> unless it were associated with
red things, it would be misleading to say that the semantical
statement &quot;'<I>Rot</I>' means <I>red</I>&quot; says of &quot;<I>rot</I>&quot;
that it [is] associated with red things. For this would suggest
that the semantical statement is, so to speak definitional
shorthand for a longer statement about the associative
connections of &quot;<I>rot</I>,&quot; which is not the case. The rubric
&quot;'. . .' means - - -&quot; is a linguistic device for conveying the
information that a <I>mentioned</I> word, in this case
&quot;<I>rot</I>,&quot; plays the same role in a certain linguistic
economy, in this case the linguistic economy of German-speaking
peoples, as does the word &quot;red,&quot; which is not <I>mentioned</I>
but <I>used</I> -- used in a unique way; <I>exhibited</I>, so to
speak -- and which occurs &quot;on the right-hand side&quot; of the
semantical statement.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We see, therefore, how the two statements
<p>
<center>&quot;<I>Und</I>&quot; means <I>and</I></center>
<p>
and
<p>
<center>&quot;<I>Rot</I>&quot; means <I>red</I></center>
<p>
can tell us quite different things about &quot;<I>und</I>&quot; and
&quot;<I>rot</I>,&quot; for the first conveys the information that
&quot;<I>und</I>&quot; plays the purely formal role of a certain logical
connective, the second that &quot;<I>rot</I>&quot; plays in German the role
of the observation word &quot;red&quot; -- in spite of the fact that
<I>means</I> has the same sense in each statement, and without
having to say that the first says of &quot;<I>und</I>&quot; that it stands
in &quot;the meaning relation&quot; to Conjunction, or the second that
&quot;<I>rot</I>&quot; stands in &quot;the meaning relation&quot; to Redness.<a
HREF="epm-n.html#12" target="n">{12}</A>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These considerations make it clear that nothing whatever can be
inferred about the complexity of the role played by the word
&quot;red&quot; or about the exact way in which the word &quot;red&quot; is related
to red things, from the truth of the semantical statement &quot;'red'
means the quality <i>red</i>.&quot; And no consideration arising from
the 'Fido'-Fido aspect of the grammar of &quot;means&quot; precludes one
from claiming that the role of the word &quot;red&quot; by virtue of which
it can correctly be said to have the meaning it does is a
complicated one indeed, and that one cannot understand the
meaning of the word &quot;red&quot; -- &quot;know what redness is&quot; -- uniess one has
a great deal of knowledge which classical empiricism would have
held to have a purely contingent relationship with the possession
of fundamental empirical concepts.
