<h3>V. IMPRESSIONS AND IDEAS: A LOGICAL POINT</h3>
</center><p>
24. Let me return to beating the neighboring bushes. Notice that
a common descriptive component of the three experiences I am
considering is itself often referred to (by philosophers, at
least) as an <i>experience</i> -- as, for example, an <i>immediate
experience</i>. Here caution is necessary. The notorious &quot;ing-ed&quot;
ambiguity of &quot;experience&quot; must be kept in mind. For although
<i>seeing that x, over there, is red</i> is an
<i>experiencing</i> -- indeed, a paradigm case of experiencing -- it
does not follow that the descriptive content of this experiencing
is itself an experienc<i>ing</i>. Furthermore, because the fact that
<i>x, over there, looks to Jones to be red</i> would be a
<i>seeing</i>, on Jones' part, <i>that x, over there, is red</i>,
if its propositional content were true, and because if it
<i>were</i> a seeing, it <i>would be</i> an experiencing, we must
beware of concluding that the fact that <i>x, over there, looks
red to Jones</i> is itself an <i>experiencing</i>. Certainly, the
fact that something looks red to me can itself be
<i>experienced</i>. But it is not itself an experiencing.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All this is not to say that the common descriptive core may not
turn out to be an experienc<i>ing</i>,<A HREF="epm-n.html#9" target="n">{9}</A> though the chances that
this is so appear less with each step in my argument. On the
other hand, I can say that it is a component in states of affairs
which are experienc<i>ed</i>, and it does not seem unreasonable
to say that it is itself experienc<i>ed</i>. But what kind of
experience (in the sense of experienc<i>ed</i>) <i>is</i> it? If
my argument to date is sound, I cannot say that it is a
<i>red</i> experience, that is, a red experienced item. I could,
of course, introduce a new use of &quot;red&quot; according to which to say
of an 'immediate experience' that it was red, would be the
stipulated equivalent of characterizing it as that
which could be the common descriptive component of a
<i>seeing</i> that something is red, and the corresponding
qualitative and existential <i>lookings</i>. This would give us a
<i>predicate</i> by which to describe and report
the experience, but we should, of course, be only verbally better
off than if we could only refer to this kind of experience as
<i>the kind which</i> could be the common descriptive component
of a <i>seeing</i> and a qualitative or existential
<i>looking</i>. And this makes it clear that one way of putting
what we are after is by saying that we want to have a <i>name</i>
for this kind of experience which is truly a <i>name</i>, and not
just shorthand for a definite description. Does ordinary usage
have a <i>name</i> for this kind of experience?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I shall return to this quest in a moment. In the meantime it is
important to clear the way of a traditional obstacle to
understanding the status of such things as <i>sensations of red
triangles</i>. Thus, suppose I were to say that while the
experience I am examining is not a red experience, it is an
experience <i>of red</i>. I could expect the immediate challenge:
&quot;Is 'sensation of a red triangle' any better off than 'red and
triangular experience'? Does not the existence of a sensation of
a red triangle entail the existence of a red and triangular item,
and hence, <i>always on the assumption that red is a property of
physical objects</i>, of a red and triangular physical object?
Must you not, therefore abandon this assumption, and return to
the framework of sense contents which you have so far refused to
do?&quot;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One way out of [this] dilemma would be to assimilate &quot;Jones has a
sensation of a red triangle&quot; to &quot;Jones believes in a divine
Huntress.&quot; For the truth of the latter does not, of course,
entail the existence of a divine Huntress. Now, I think that most
contemporary philosophers are clear that it is possible to
attribute to the context
<p>
<center>. . . sensation of . . .</center>
<p>
the <i>logical</i> property of being such that &quot;There is a
sensation of a red triangle&quot; does not entail &quot;There is a red
triangle&quot; without assimilating the context &quot;. . . sensation of .
. .&quot; to the context &quot;. . . believes in . . .&quot; in any closer way.
For while mentalistic verbs characteristically provide
nonextensional contexts (when they are not &quot;achievement&quot; or
&quot;endorsing&quot; words), not all nonextensional contexts are
mentalistic. Thus, as far as the purely <i>logical</i> point is
concerned, there is no reason why &quot;Jones has a sensation of a red
triangle&quot; should be assimilated to &quot;Jones believes in a divine
Huntress&quot; rather than to &quot;It is possible that the moon is made of
green cheese&quot; or to any of the other nonextensional contexts
familiar to logicians. Indeed there is no reason why it should be
assimilated to any of these. &quot;. . . sensation of . . .&quot; or &quot;. . .
impression of . . .&quot; could be a context which, though sharing
with these others the logical property of nonextensionality, was
otherwise in a class by itself.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
25. Yet there is no doubt but that <i>historically</i> the
contexts &quot;. . . sensation of . . .&quot; and &quot;. . . impression of . .
.&quot; <i>were</i> assimilated to such mentalistic contexts as &quot;. . .
believes . . .,&quot; &quot;. . . desires . . .,&quot; &quot;. . . chooses . . .,&quot; in
short to contexts which are either themselves 'propositional
attitudes' or involve propositional attitudes in their analysis.
This assimilation took the form of classifying sensations with
<i>ideas</i> or <i>thoughts</i>. Thus Descartes uses the word
&quot;thought&quot; to cover not only <i>judgments, inferences, desires,
volitions</i>, and (occurrent) <i>ideas of abstract
qualities</i>, but also <i>sensations, feelings</i>, and
<i>images</i>. Locke, in the same spirit, uses the term &quot;idea&quot;
with similar scope. The apparatus of Conceptualism, which had its
genesis in the controversy over universals, was given a
correspondingly wide application. Just as objects and situations
were said to have 'objective being' in our <i>thoughts</i>, when
we think of them, or judge them to obtain -- as contrasted with the
'subjective' or 'formal being' which they have in the world -- so,
when we have a sensation of a red triangle, the red triangle was
supposed to have 'objective being' in our sensation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In elaborating, for a moment, this conceptualistic interpretation
of sensation, let me refer to that which has 'objective being' in
a <i>thought</i> or <i>idea</i> as its <i>content</i> or
<i>immanent object</i>. Then I can say that the fundamental
difference between occurrent <i>abstract ideas</i> and
<i>sensations</i>, for both Locke and Descartes, lay in the
<i>specificity</i> and, above all, the <i>complexity</i> of the
content of the latter. (Indeed, both Descartes and Locke
assimilated the contrast between the simple and the complex in
ideas to that between the generic and the specific.) Descartes
thinks of sensations as confused thoughts of their external
cause; Spinoza of sensations and images as confused thoughts of
bodily states, and still more confused thoughts of the external
causes of these bodily states. And it is interesting to note that
the conceptualistic thesis that abstract entities have only
<i>esse intentionale</i> (their <i>esse</i> is <i>concipi</i>) is
extended by Descartes and, with less awareness of what he is
doing, Locke, to include the thesis that colors, sounds, etc.,
exist &quot;only in the mind&quot; (their <i>esse</i> is <i>percipi</i>)
and by Berkeley to cover all perceptible qualities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, I think we would all agree, today, that this assimilation of
sensations to thoughts is a mistake. It is sufficient to note
that if &quot;sensation of a red triangle&quot; had the sense of &quot;episode
of the kind which is the common descriptive component of those
experiences which <i>would be</i> cases of seeing that the facing
surface of a physical object is red and triangular if an object
<i>were</i> presenting a red and triangular facing surface&quot; then
it would have the nonextensionality the noticing of which led to
this mistaken assimilation. But while we have indeed escaped from
this blind alley, it is small consolation. For we are no further
along in the search for a 'direct' or 'intrinsic'
characterization of 'immediate experience.'
