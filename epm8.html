<center><h3>VIII. DOES EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE HAVE A FOUNDATION?</h3></center>

<a name="sec32"></a>32. One of the forms taken by the Myth of the Given is the idea
that there is, indeed <i>must be</i>, a structure of particular
matter of fact such that (a) each fact can not
only be noninferentially known to be the case, but presupposes
no other knowledge either of particular matter of fact, or of
general truths; and (b) such that the noninferential
knowledge of facts belonging to this structure constitutes the
ultimate court of appeals for all factual claims -- particular and
general -- about the world. It is important to note that I
characterized the knowledge of fact belonging to this stratum as
not only noninferential, but as presupposing no knowledge of
other matter of fact, whether particular or general. It might be
thought that this is a redundancy, that knowledge (not belief or
conviction, but knowledge) which logically presupposes knowledge
of other facts <i>must</i> be inferential. This, however, as I
hope to show, is itself an episode in the Myth.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, the idea of such a privileged stratum of fact is a  
familiar one, though not without its difficulties. Knowledge
pertaining to this level is <i>noninferential</i>, yet it is,
after all, <i>knowledge</i>. It is <i>ultimate</i>, yet it has
<i>authority</i>. The attempt to make a consistent picture of
these two requirements has traditionally taken the following
form:
<p>
<blockquote>
Statements pertaining to this level, in order to 'express
knowledge' must not only be made, but, so to speak, must be
worthy of being made, <i>credible</i>, that is, in the sense of
worthy of credence. Furthermore, and this is a crucial point,
they must be made in a way which <i>involves</i> this
credibility. For where there is no connection between the making
of a statement and its authority, the assertion may express
<i>conviction</i>, but it can scarcely be said to express
knowledge.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The authority -- the credibility -- of statements pertaining to this
level cannot exhaustively consist in the fact that they are
supported by <i>other</i> statements, for in that case all
<i>knowledge</i> pertaining to this level would have to be
inferential, which not only contradicts the hypothesis, but flies
in the face of good sense. The conclusion seems inevitable that
if some statements pertaining to this level are to express
<i>noninferential</i> knowledge, they must have a credibility
which is not a matter of being supported by other statements. Now
there does seem to be a class of statements which fill at least
part of this bill, namely such statements as would be said to
<i>report observations</i>, thus, &quot;This is red.&quot; These
statements, candidly made, have authority. Yet they are not
expressions of inference. How, then, is this authority to be
understood?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Clearly, the argument continues, it springs from the fact that
they are made in just the circumstances in which they are made,
as is indicated by the fact that they characteristically, though
not necessarily or without exception, involve those so-called
token-reflexive expressions which, in addition to the tenses of
verbs, serve to connect the circumstances in which a statement is
made with its sense. (At this point it will be helpful to begin
putting the line of thought I am developing in terms of the
<i>fact-stating</i> and <i>observation-reporting</i> roles of
certain sentences.) Roughly, two verbal performances which are
tokens of a non-token-reflexive sentence can occur in widely
different circumstances and yet make the same statement;
whereas two tokens of a token-reflexive sentence can make the
same statement only if they are uttered in the same circumstances
(according to a relevant criterion of sameness). And two tokens
of a sentence, whether it contains a token-reflexive
expression -- over and above a tensed verb -- or not, can make the
same <i>report</i> only if, made in all candor, they express the
<i>presence</i> -- in <i>some</i> sense of &quot;presence&quot; -- of the
state of affairs that is being reported; if, that is, they stand
in that relation to the state of affairs, whatever the relation
may be, by virtue of which they can be said to formulate
observations of it.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It would appear, then, that there are two ways in which a
sentence token can have credibility: (1) The authority may accrue
to it, so to speak, from above, that is, as being a token of a 
sentence type <i>all</i> the token of which, in a certain use,
have credibility, e.g. &quot;2+2=4&quot;. In this case, let us say that
token credibility is inherited from type authority. (2) The
credibility may accrue to it from the fact that it came to exist
in a certain way in a certain set of circumstances, e.g. &quot;This is
red.&quot; Here token credibility is not derived from type
credibility.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now. the credibility of <i>some</i> sentence types appears to
be <i>intrinsic</i> -- at least in the limited sense that it is
<i>not</i> derived from other sentences, type or token. This is,
or seems to be, the case with certain sentences used to make
analytic statements. The credibility of <i>some</i> sentence types
accrues to them by virtue of their logical relations to other
sentence types, thus by virtue
of the fact that they are logical consequences of more basic
sentences. It would seem obvious, however, that the credibility
of empirical sentence types cannot be traced without remainder to
the credibility of other sentence types. And since no empirical
sentence type appears to have <i>intrinsic</i> credibility,
this means that credibility must accrue to <i>some</i> empirical
sentence types by virtue of their logical relations to certain
sentence tokens, and, indeed, to sentence tokens the authority of
which is not derived, in its turn, from the authority of sentence
types.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The picture we get is that of there being two <i>ultimate</i>
modes of credibility: (1) The intrinsic credibility of analytic
sentences, which accrues to tokens as being tokens of such a
type; (2) the credibility of such tokens as &quot;express
observations,&quot; a credibility which flows from tokens to
types.
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec33"></a>33. Let us explore this picture, which is common to all
traditional empiricisms, a bit further. How is the authority of
such sentence tokens as &quot;express observational knowledge&quot; to be
understood? It has been tempting to suppose that in spite of the
obvious differences which exist between &quot;observation reports&quot; and
&quot;analytic statements,&quot; there is an essential similarity between
the ways in which they come by their authority. Thus, it has been
claimed, not without plausibility, that whereas <i>ordinary</i>
empirical statements can be <i>correctly</i> made without
being <i>true</i>, observation reports resemble analytic
statements in that being correctly made is a sufficient as well
as necessary condition of their truth. And it has been inferred
from this -- somewhat hastily, I believe -- that &quot;correctly making&quot;
the report &quot;This is green&quot; is a matter of &quot;following the rules
for the use of 'this,' 'is' and 'green.'&quot;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Three comments are immediately necessary:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1) First a brief remark about the term &quot;report.&quot; In ordinary
usage a report is a report made <i>by</i> someone <i>to</i>
someone. To make a report is to <i>do</i> something. In the
literature of epistemology, however, the word &quot;report&quot; or &quot;<i>Konstatierung</i>&quot; has
acquired a technical use in which a sentence token can play a reporting role
(a) without being an <i>overt</i> verbal performance,
and (b) without
having the character of being &quot;by someone to someone&quot; -- even 
oneself. There is, of course, such a thing as &quot;talking to
oneself&quot; -- <i>in foro interno</i> -- but, as I shall be
emphasizing in the
closing stages of my argument, it is important not to suppose
that all &quot;covert&quot; verbal episodes are of this kind.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(2) My second comment is that while <i>we</i> shall not assume
that because 'reports' <i>in the ordinary sense</i> are
<i>actions</i>, 'reports' in the sense of <i>Konstatierungen</i> are also actions, the line
of thought we are considering treats them as such. In other words,
it interprets the correctness of <i>Konstatierungen</i> as
analogous to the rightness of actions. Let me emphasize, however, that not all
<i>ought</i> is <i>ought to do</i>, not all correctness the
correctness of <i>actions</i>.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(3) My third comment is that if the expression &quot;following a rule&quot;
is taken seriously, and is not weakened beyond all recognition
into the bare notion of exhibiting a uniformity -- in which case
the lightning-thunder sequence would &quot;follow a rule&quot; -- then it is
the knowledge or belief that the circumstances are of a certain
kind, and not the mere fact that they <i>are</i> of this kind,
which contributes to bringing about the action.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec34"></a>34. In the light of these remarks it is clear that <i>if</i>
observation reports are construed as <i>actions</i>, <i>if</i>
their correctness is interpreted as the correctness of an <i>action</i>, and <i>if</i> the authority of an observation report is construed as the fact that making it 
is &quot;following a rule&quot; in the proper sense of this phrase, <i>then</i> we are face to face with givenness in its most straightforward form. For these stipulations commit one to the idea that the authority of <i>Konstatierungen</i> rests on nonverbal episodes of awareness -- awareness <i>that</i> something
is the case, e.g. <i>that this is green</i> -- which nonverbal
episodes have an intrinsic authority (they are, so to speak,
'self-authenticating') which the <i>verbal</i>
performances (the <i>Konstatierungen</i>) properly performed &quot;express.&quot; One
is committed to a stratum of authoritative nonverbal episodes
(&quot;awarenesses&quot;), the authority of which accrues to a
superstructure of <i>verbal actions</i>, provided that the
expressions occurring in these actions are properly <i>used</i>.
These self-authenticating episodes would constitute the tortoise
on which stands the elephant on which rests the edifice of empirical
knowledge. The essence of the view is the same whether these
intrinsically authoritative episodes are such items as the
awareness that a certain sense content is green or such items as the awareness that a certain physical object looks to oneself to be green.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec35"></a>35. But what is the alternative? We might begin by trying
something like the following: An overt or covert token of &quot;This
is green&quot; in the presence of a green item is a
<i>Konstatierung</i> and expresses observational knowledge if and
only if it is a manifestation of a tendency to produce overt or
covert tokens of &quot;This is green&quot; -- given a certain set -- if and
only if a green object is being looked at in standard conditions.
Clearly on this interpretation the occurrence of such tokens of
&quot;This is green&quot; would be &quot;following a rule&quot; only in the sense
that they are instances of a uniformity, a uniformity differing
from the lightning-thunder case in that it is an acquired causal
characteristic of the language user. Clearly the above
suggestion, which corresponds to the &quot;thermometer view&quot;
criticized by Professor Price, and which we have already
rejected, won't do as it stands. Let us see, however, if it
cannot be revised to fit the criteria I have been using for
&quot;expressing observational knowledge.&quot;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first hurdle to be jumped concerns the <i>authority</i>
which, as I have emphasized, a sentence token must have in order
that it may be said to express knowledge. Clearly, on this
account the only thing that can remotely be supposed to
constitute such authority is the fact that one can infer the
presence of a green object from the fact that someone makes this
report.  As we have already noticed, the correctness of a report
does not have to be construed as the rightness of an <i>action</i>. A report can be correct as being an instance of a general mode of behavior which, in a given linguistic community, it is reasonable to sanction and support.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The second hurdle is, however, the decisive one. For we have seen
that to be the expression of knowledge, a report must not only
have authority, this authority must <i>in some sense</i> be
recognized by the person whose report it is. And this is a steep
hurdle indeed. For if the authority of the report &quot;This is green&quot;
lies in the fact that the existence of green items appropriately
related to the perceiver can be inferred from the occurrence of
such reports, it follows that only a person who is able to draw
this inference, and therefore who has not only the concept
<i>green</i>, but also the concept of uttering &quot;This is
green&quot; -- indeed, the concept of certain conditions of perception,
those which would correctly be called 'standard
conditions' -- could be in a position to token &quot;This is green&quot; in
recognition of its authority. In other words, for a
<i>Konstatierung</i> &quot;This is green&quot; to &quot;express observational
knowledge,&quot; not only must it be a <i>symptom</i> or <i>sign</i>
of the presence of a green object in standard conditions, but the
perceiver must know that tokens of &quot;This is green&quot; <i>are</i>
symptoms of the presence of green objects in conditions which are
standard for visual perception.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec36"></a>36. Now it might be thought that there is something obviously
absurd in the idea that before a token uttered by, say, Jones
could be the expression of observational knowledge, Jones would
have to know that overt verbal episodes of this kind are reliable
indicators of the existence, suitably related to the speaker, of
green objects. I do not think that it is. Indeed, I think that
something very like it is true. The point I wish to make now,
however, is that if it <i>is</i> true, then it follows, as a
matter of simple logic, that one could not have observational
knowledge of <i>any</i> fact unless one knew many <i>other</i>
things as well. And let me emphasize that the point is not taken
care of by distinguishing between <i>knowing how</i> and
<i>knowing that</i>, and admitting that observational knowledge
requires a lot of &quot;know how.&quot; For the point is specifically that
observational knowledge of any particular fact, e.g. that this is
green, presupposes that one knows general facts of the form <i>X
is a reliable symptom of Y</i>. And to admit this requires an
abandonment of the traditional empiricist idea that observational
knowledge &quot;stands on its own feet.&quot; Indeed, the suggestion would
be anathema to traditional empiricists for the obvious reason
that by making observational knowledge <i>presuppose</i>
knowledge of general facts of the form <i>X is a reliable symptom
of Y</i>, it runs counter to the idea that we come to know
general facts of this form only <i>after</i> we have come to know
by observation a number of particular facts which support the
hypothesis that X is a symptom of Y.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And it might be thought that there is an obvious regress in the
view we are examining. Does it not tell us that observational
knowledge at time t presupposes knowledge of the form <i>X is a
reliable symptom of Y</i>, which presupposes <i>prior</i>
observational knowledge, which presupposes <i>other</i> knowledge
of the form <i>X is a reliable symptom of Y</i>, which
presupposes still other, and <i>prior</i>, observational
knowledge, and so on? This charge, however, rests on too simple,
indeed a radically mistaken, conception of what one is saying of
Jones when one says that he <i>knows</i> that-p. It is not just
that the objection supposes that knowing is an <i>episode</i>;
for clearly there are episodes which we can correctly
characterize as knowings, in particular, <i>observings</i>. The
essential point is that in characterizing an episode or a state
as that of <i>knowing</i>, we are not giving an empirical
description of that episode or state; we are placing it in the
logical space of reasons, of justifying and being able to justify
what one says.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec37"></a>37. Thus, all that the view I am defending requires is that no
tokening by S <i>now</i> of &quot;This is green&quot; is to count as
&quot;expressing observational knowledge&quot; unless it is also correct to
say of S that he <i>now</i> knows the appropriate fact of the
form <i>X is a reliable symptom of Y</i>, namely that (and again
I oversimplify) utterances of &quot;This is green&quot; are reliable
indicators of the presence of green objects in standard
conditions of perception. And while the correctness of this
statement about Jones requires that Jones could <i>now</i> cite
prior particular facts as evidence for the idea that these
utterances <i>are</i> reliable indicators, it requires only that
it is correct to say that Jones <i>now</i> knows, thus
remembers<A HREF="epm-n.html#13" target="n">{13}</A>, that these
particular facts <i>did</i> obtain. It
does not require that it be correct to say that at the time these
facts did obtain he <i>then knew</i> them to obtain. And the
regress disappears.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thus, while Jones's ability to give inductive reasons
<i>today</i> is built on a long history of acquiring and
manifesting verbal habits in perceptual situations, and, in
particular, the occurrence of verbal episodes, e.g.&quot;This is
green,&quot; which is superficially like those which are later
properly said to express observational knowledge, it does not
require that any episode in this prior time be characterizeable
as expressing knowledge. (At this point, the reader should reread
<a href="epm3.html#sec19">Section 19</a> above.)
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="sec38"></a>38. The idea that observation &quot;strictly and properly so-called&quot;
is constituted by certain self-authenticating nonverbal episodes,
the authority of which is transmitted to verbal and quasi-verbal
performances when these performances are made &quot;in conformity with
the semantical rules of the language,&quot; is, of course, the heart
of the Myth of the Given, For the <i>given</i>, in
epistemological tradition, is what is <i>taken</i> by these
self-authenticating episodes. These 'takings' are, so to speak,
the unmoved movers of empirical knowledge, the 'knowings in
presence' which are presupposed by all other knowledge, both the
knowledge of general truths and the knowledge 'in absence' of
other particular matters of fact. Such is the framework in which
traditional empiricism makes its characteristic claim that the
perceptually given is the foundation of empirical knowledge.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let me make it clear, however, that if I reject this framework,
it is not because I should deny that observings are <i>inner</i>
episodes, nor that <i>strictly speaking</i> they are
<i>nonverbal</i> episodes. It will be my contention, however,
that the sense in which they are nonverbal -- which is also the
sense in which thought episodes are nonverbal is one which gives
no aid or comfort to epistemological givenness. In the concluding
sections of this paper, I shall attempt to explicate the logic of
inner episodes, and show that we can distinguish between
observations and thoughts, on the one hand, and their verbal
expression on the other, without making the mistakes of
traditional dualism. I shall also attempt to explicate the
logical status of <i>impressions</i> or <i>immediate
experiences</i>, and thus bring to a successful conclusion the
quest with which my argument began.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One final remark before I begin this task. If I reject the
framework of traditional empiricism, it is not because I want to
say that empirical knowledge has <i>no</i> foundation. For to put
it this way is to suggest that it is really &quot;empirical knowledge
so-called,&quot; and to put it in a box with rumors and hoaxes. There
is clearly <i>some</i> point to the picture of human knowledge as
resting on a level of propositions -- observation reports -- which do
not rest on other propositions in the same way as other
propositions rest on them. On the other hand, I do wish to insist
that the metaphor of &quot;foundation&quot; is misleading in that it keeps
us from seeing that if there is a logical dimension in which
other empirical propositions rest on observation reports, there
is another logical dimension in which the latter rest on the
former.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Above all</i>, the picture is misleading because of its
static character. One seems forced to choose between the picture
of an elephant which rests on a tortoise (What supports the
tortoise?) and the picture of a great Hegelian serpent of
knowledge with its tail in its mouth (Where does it begin?).
Neither will do. For empirical knowledge, like its sophisticated
extension, science, is rational, not because it has a <i>foundation</i> but because it is a self-correcting enterprise
which can put <i>any</i> claim in jeopardy, though not <i>all</i>
at once.<p>
