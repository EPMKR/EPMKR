        <a name="4"></a>{4} (Added 1963) When John has mastered looks
        talk he will be
        able to say not only "The tie looks green" but "The tie looks to
        be blue," where the latter has the sense of ". . . looks as blue
        ties look in these circumstances." The distinction between "looks
        <font face="symbol">f</font>" and "looks to be <font face="symbol">f</font>" corresponds to Chisholm's
        distinction between non-comparative and comparative "appears" --
        statements.

        <a name="4"></a>{4} (1963 년도 판에 추가)
        존이 '~처럼 보인다'라는 표현을 완전히 이해하게 되면, 그는 단순히 "그 넥타이가 초록색으로 보인다"라고 말하는 것뿐만 아니라 "그 넥타이가 파란색인 것처럼 보인다"라고도 말할 수 있게 될 것이다. 여기서 후자의
        표현은 "이러한 상황에서 파란 넥타이가 보이는 것처럼 보인다"라는 의미를 가진다. "looks φ"와 "looks to be φ"의 구분은
        키즘(Chisholm)이 제시한 비교하지 않는 (non-comparative)
        '나타나다(appears)' 진술과 비교적(comparative) '나타나다' 진술의 구분에 해당한다

        <a name="5"></a>{5} (Added 1963) Standard circumstances are,
        indeed, the circumstances in which things look as they are. But the non-trivial character of the above formula
        emerges when we replace "standard circumstances" by the mention of a specific kind of
        circumstance (e.g. daylight) and add that daylight is the
        standard circumstance of perception, i.e. the condition in which
        color words have their primary perceptual use.
    </p>
    <p>

        <a name="6"></a>{6} (Added 1963) The argument can admit a
        distinction in principle between a rudimentary concept of "green" which could be learned without learning the
        logical space of looks talk, and a
        richer concept of "green" in which "is green" can be challenged by "merely looks green." The essential point is
        that even to have the more rudimentary concept presupposes having a battery of
        other concepts.

        circumstances were normal.

    <p>
        <a name="9"></a>{9} (Added 1963) The term "experiencing" in the
        question "Is the common descriptive component an experiencing?"
        is used in an epistemic sense. In the non-epistemic sense of an
        "undergoing," the common descriptive component is, of course, an
        experiencing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="10"></a>{10} For a systematic elaboration and defense of the following interpretation of Locke,
        Berkeley, and Hume, the reader should consult "Berkeley's Critique of Abstract Ideas," a Ph.D. thesis by John
        Linnell, submitted to the Graduate Faculty of the University of Minnesota, June, 1954.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="11"></a>{11} I say that Locke was "on the whole" committed
        to the view that there can be an idea which is <i>of</i> the
        genus without being <i>of</i> any of its species, because while
        he saw that it couldn't be any one of the species to the
        exclusion of the others, and saw no way of avoiding this except
        by making it of <i>none</i> of the species, he was greatly
        puzzled by this, for he saw that in some sense the idea <i>of the
            genus</i> must be <i>of all the species</i>. We have already
        noted that if he had admitted disjunction as a principle of
        compounding ideas, he could have said that the idea <i>of the
            genus</i> is the idea <i>of the disjunction of all its
            species</i>, that the idea of <i>being triangular</i> is the
        idea of <i>being scalene or isosceles</i>. As it was, he thought
        that to be of all the species it would have to be the idea of
        <i>being scalene and isosceles</i>, which is, of course, the idea
        of an impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is interesting to note that if Berkeley had faced up to the
        implications of the criterion we shall find him to have adopted,
        this disjunctive conception of the generic idea is the one he
        would have been led to adopt. For since <i>being</i> G -- where 'G'
        stands for a generic character -- entails being S<sub>1</sub> or S<sub>2</sub> or S<sub>3</sub> . .
        . . . or S<sub>n</sub>, -- where 'S<sub>1</sub>' stands for a specific character falling
        under G -- Berkeley should have taken as the unit of ideas
        concerning triangles, the idea of the genus Triangle as
        differentiated into the set of specific forms of triangularity.
        But, needless to say, if Berkeley <i>had</i> taken this step, he
        could not have thought of a sensation of crimson as a determinate
        <i>thought</i>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <a name="13"></a>{13} (Added 1963) My thought was that one can have
        direct (non-inferential) knowledge of a past fact which one did
        not or even (as in the case envisaged) could not conceptualize at
        the time it was present.
