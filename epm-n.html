<a name="2"></a>{2} A useful discussion of views of this type is
to be found in Roderick Chisholm's "The Theory of Appearing," in
Max Black
(ed.), <i>Philosophical Analysis</i>, pp. 102-18. Ithaca: Cornell
Univ. Press, 1950 and in H.H. Price's <i>Perception</i>. London:
Methuen, 1932.

<a name="4"></a>{4} (Added 1963) When John has mastered looks
talk he will be
able to say not only "The tie looks green" but "The tie looks to
be blue," where the latter has the sense of ". . . looks as blue
ties look in these circumstances." The distinction between "looks
�" and "looks to be �" corresponds to Chisholm's
distinction between non-comparative and comparative "appears" -- 
statements. 
</p><p>
<a name="5"></a>{5} (Added 1963) Standard circumstances are,
indeed, the circumstances in which things look as they are. But the non-trivial character of the above formula emerges when we replace "standard circumstances" by the mention of a specific kind of
circumstance (e.g. daylight) and add that daylight is the
standard circumstance of perception, i.e. the condition in which
color words have their primary perceptual use. 
</p><p>

<a name="6"></a>{6} (Added 1963) The argument can admit a
distinction in principle between a rudimentary concept of "green" which could be learned without learning the logical space of looks talk, and a
richer concept of "green" in which "is green" can be challenged by "merely looks green." The essential point is that even to have the more rudimentary concept presupposes having a battery of
other concepts.

circumstances were normal.

</p><p>
<a name="9"></a>{9} (Added 1963) The term "experiencing" in the
question "Is the common descriptive component an experiencing?"
is used in an epistemic sense. In the non-epistemic sense of an
"undergoing," the common descriptive component is, of course, an
experiencing. 
</p><p>
<a name="10"></a>{10} For a systematic elaboration and defense of the following interpretation of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, the reader should consult "Berkeley's Critique of Abstract Ideas," a Ph.D. thesis by John Linnell, submitted to the Graduate Faculty of the University of Minnesota, June, 1954. 
</p><p>
<a name="11"></a>{11} I say that Locke was "on the whole" committed
to the view that there can be an idea which is <i>of</i> the
genus without being <i>of</i> any of its species, because while
he saw that it couldn't be any one of the species to the
exclusion of the others, and saw no way of avoiding this except
by making it of <i>none</i> of the species, he was greatly
puzzled by this, for he saw that in some sense the idea <i>of the
genus</i> must be <i>of all the species</i>. We have already
noted that if he had admitted disjunction as a principle of
compounding ideas, he could have said that the idea <i>of the
genus</i> is the idea <i>of the disjunction of all its
species</i>, that the idea of <i>being  triangular</i> is the
idea of <i>being scalene or isosceles</i>. As it was, he thought
that to be of all the species it would have to be the idea of
<i>being scalene and isosceles</i>, which is, of course, the idea
of an impossibility.
</p><p>
It is interesting to note that if Berkeley had faced up to the
implications of the criterion we shall find him to have adopted,
this disjunctive conception of the generic idea is the one he
would have been led to adopt. For since <i>being</i> G -- where 'G'
stands for a generic character -- entails being S<sub>1</sub> or S<sub>2</sub> or S<sub>3</sub> . .
. . . or S<sub>n</sub>, -- where 'S<sub>1</sub>' stands for a specific character falling
under G -- Berkeley should have taken as the unit of ideas
concerning triangles, the idea of the genus Triangle as
differentiated into the set of specific forms of triangularity.
But, needless to say, if Berkeley <i>had</i> taken this step, he
could not have thought of a sensation of crimson as a determinate
<i>thought</i>.

entities built on this interpretation of semantical statements,

<a name="13"></a>{13} (Added 1963) My thought was that one can have
direct (non-inferential) knowledge of a past fact which one did
not or even (as in the case envisaged) could not conceptualize at
the time it was present.
